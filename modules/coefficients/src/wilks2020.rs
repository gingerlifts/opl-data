/// Calculates Wilks2020 points.
///
/// This formula was updated as of 2020-03-09. The USPA provided us with a formula
/// definition directly sent to them by Robert Wilks. That definition does not match
/// the previously-published Wilks2020 coefficient tables. We assume that Robert Wilks
/// silently updated them.
///
/// In 2020, Robert Wilks announced that he was updating his formula based on new data.
/// He published large coefficient tables, and apparently refused to tell anyone the
/// underlying formula for calculating the coefficients. He also suggested that the
/// formula was not stable, and that he would be adjusting the coefficients over time.
///
/// Wilks2020 unfortunately produces points on an intentionally different scale than
/// the original Wilks formula: instead of being based around 500 points, it uses 600.
/// The scale difference means that the new formula is not a drop-in replacement for
/// the old one, and therefore the old formula will continue to be used. We handle
/// this by just treating the new version as a completely different formula, and have
/// named it "Wilks2020" to note the distinction.
///
/// One problem we will have is that if Robert Wilks continues to update the coefficients,
/// we will have to make a new formula each time he does so, because the display of old
/// meet results requires us to calculate the formula in use *at that time for that meet*.
/// If we updated this formula, we would be incorrect for historical results.
///
/// The official coefficients are published at:
///   https://powerliftingaustralia.com/wilks-formula/
///
/// The formula comes via York Stanham, who converted it from a PA/WP spreadsheet.
