/// Calculates the Schwartz coefficient, used for men.
///
/// The Schwartz formula replaced the Hoffman formula.
/// Schwartz was proposed around February 1971.
///
/// The exact formula was found in the magazine Powerlifting USA,
/// Vol.6, No.2, August 1982, on page 61. That text is reproduced below:
///
/// Computerized Schwartz Formula...Dr. Lyle Schwartz has often been
/// asked for a means by which the formula he has given Powerlifting can be
/// programmed into a computer or a hand held calculator with sufficient
/// memory. To obtain the Schwartz Formula (SF) for bodyweights (BW) bet-
/// ween 40 and 126 kg, the expression is: SF = 0.631926 exp(+01) -
/// 0.262349 exp(+00) (BW) + 0.511550 exp(-02) (BW)^2 - 0.519738
/// exp(-04) (BW)^3 + 0.267626 exp(-06) (BW)^4 - 0.540132 exp(-09)
/// (BW)^5 - 0.728875 exp(-13) (BW)^6. For higher bodyweights, the follow-
/// ing simple formulae are used: for BW 126-136, SF = 0.5210-0.0012
/// (BW - 125), for BW 136-146, SF = 0.5090-0011 (BW - 135), for BW
/// 146-156, SF = 0.4980-0.0010 (BW - 145), and for BW 156-166, SF =
/// 0.4880-0.0090 (BW - 156)
///
/// Schwartz is quoted as saying about the formula's development,
///
/// "Since powerlifting was still a young sport in the early 1970s
/// there was uneven development in the three lifts on the part of most
/// self-trained athletes. I compensated for such unevenness by creating
/// artificial 'best' totals by adding together the current records in the
/// individual lifts. A 'best' total would have been achieved by that ideal
/// lifter who could match the best performances to date in all three
/// powerlifts. Then I fitted these data to an artificial curve and picked
/// off numbers from the curve."
