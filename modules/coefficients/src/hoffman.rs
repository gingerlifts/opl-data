/// Calculates Hoffman points.
///
/// TODO: This is probably inaccurate. We're going off a description from Schwarz,
/// and a single datapoint that someone quoted Hoffman as saying.
/// TODO: Find out more about the formula. Maybe a coefficient table, at least!
///
/// Lyle Schwartz described the Hoffman formula thusly (in Reference 1):
///
///   Imagine two balloons in the shape of a lifter, one larger than the other.
///   If we can match the big one by blowing air into the smaller, all dimensions
///   growing in the same proportion, then the original two balloons can be said
///   to be similar. Body weight in similar objects increases as the cube of any
///   length (for example height), while strength presumably depends on how big
///   the muscles are and that increases as the square of a linear dimension.
///
/// The Hoffman formula seems to have been created around 1958. It was used primarily
/// in Olympic weightlifting, but was also used for powerlifting competitions
/// as they started around the 1960s.

    ///   Back in 1942, Davis lifting as a heavyweight for the first time,
    ///   WEIGHING ONLY 200, officially pressed 322(!) in winning the National title
    ///   at the Arena in Philadelphia. This lift would give John a formula
