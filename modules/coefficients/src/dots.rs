/// Calculates Dots points.

/// Dots were introduced by the German IPF Affiliate BVDK after the IPF switched to
/// IPF Points, which do not allow comparing between sexes. The BVDK hosts team
/// competitions that allow lifters of all sexes to compete on a singular team.
///
/// Since Wilks points have been ostracized from the IPF, and IPF Points are
/// unsuitable, German lifters therefore came up with their own formula.
///
/// The author of the Dots formula is Tim Konertz <tim.konertz@outlook.com>.
///
/// Tim says that Dots is an acronym for "Dynamic Objective Team Scoring,"
/// but that they chose the acronym before figuring out the expansion.
