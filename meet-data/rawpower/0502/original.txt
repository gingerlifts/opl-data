Results of the Kokemäki qualifying competition on May 14, 2005	05/15/2005
The second qualifying race of 2005 was held in the KKV hall in Kokemäki on May 14, 2005.

The quiet race was over in two hours and two of the three powerlifters broke the score limit for their series. There were 5 lifters involved in the bench press, two of whom were “forced” to participate in three sports, as according to the rules that changed in early 2005, Raw Power Ry’s race records can only be set by participating in three sports. These guys from Rauma who broke records were Juha-Matti Järvi in ​​the -125kg series and -80kg in the Kim Päivöke series. The latter succeeded in his attempt, but Juha-Matti Järvi was 10kg behind the bench record.



Juha-Matti Järvi, who recently weighed 212.5 kg in the maximum race of a military bench, raised 227.5 kg in Kokemäki. The man was caught, despite a small resistance, to try to break the record of a hundred -125kg benches, which is currently in the name of Jyrki Heiskar. Heiskar's weight of 235kg a kilo a couple of years ago was now added to the 2.5kg rod, but the 237.5kg still weighed too much. In the picture above, Juha-Matti Järvi's next stage, lifting 210 kg of the bench's easy starting irons, is Finland's Strongest Man race at the beginning of June in Tuuri. Finnish Power wishes Juha-Mat a trick for the Finnish Championships!
