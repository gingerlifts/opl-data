We were, in fact, using a 55 pound Texas squat bar. So the lifters were all credited for 10 pounds more than the weight I announced on the microphone. For future shows, we will have a separate plate loading chart for the 55 pound squat bar and that will help with avoiding any additional confusion or miss loads.)
