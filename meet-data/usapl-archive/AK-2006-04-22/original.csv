! State Records
* K-High Records

The Spring Recordbreakers meet lived up to its nameâ€¦again.

The 9 lifters competing set 11 state records and two K-High records. In the Junior division three competitors set state records. Joseph Peterson moved up in age this meet from the Teen-3 to the Junior age group and set 4 new state records in the 114 pound weight class. Taylor Gregg bested three of her own state records to set new Squat, Deadlift, and Total records in the Junior 123 pound class. David Mann, lifting at Junior 132, set state records for the Bench, Deadlift, and Total. Floyd Frank passed his own state record Bench Press in the Master 198 pound division. His Total, adjusted for his age and weight, also gave him Best Lifter honors. Mike Bruce set two Ketchikan High School records in the Teen-2 275 pound class in the Bench and Dead.

Trevor Eubanks was welcomed back after missing December's meet and had a solid performance. He opened conservatively and nailed his opener in each of the three lifts. Troy Winchester traveled from Wrangell to compete and put up the 3rd best adjusted Total. Troy lifted in December and now he has the bug. Hopefully we'll see him in the future and maybe he can talk some of the other brutes from Wrangell to join him at the next meet. Chris Douglas and Kevin Johnson lifted in the Open 181 class. Chris, in his first 3 lift meet, went 7 for 9 attempts and will hopefully stick with it and improve for the future. Kevin had trouble in the Bench but made a 475 Deadlift look easy on his way to the second best total.

The meet had a supportive group of spectators which the lifters always appreciate. The volunteers make the meet possible and we are lucky to have a group dedicated to making these meets happen through Ketchikan's 14th year of powerlifting competition. Thanks go out to Greg Middag, Roger Fawcett, and William Bates for spotting and loading. They really do the heavy lifting and protect the competitors. Arlindo Machado and Mary Gregg our scorekeepers, kept all the numbers straight. Deborah Harney, Bob Hewitt, and Doug Gregg were the referees. Special thanks to Lisa Machado, the mother of Ketchikan powerlifting, for all of her help. This event was sponsored by Ketchikan Parks and Recreation, The Get Fit Stay Fit gym, Floyd's Carpentry, and the No Pain No Gain No Brain Masters.
