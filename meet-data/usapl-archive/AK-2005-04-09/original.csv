Ketchikan is setting another blistering pace in its 13th year of powerlifting competition and 25th meet! The Teen lifters collected four Ketchikan HS records with Mike Bruce taking 3 and Trevor Eubanks adding another one to his resume. Taylor Gregg moved up to the Junior division and set all new records in the 123 class. The Master lifters showed the youngsters how it should be done as they captured seven state records between four lifters! Greg Gass couldn't push his Bench up to 500 but he pulled it in the Deadlift. Kelly Orr returned to competition after several years absence. We hope to see him at the winter meet. Pat Stack pushed his total up 70 pounds to smash the 1500 total. His 1540 total gave him Best Lifter honors and saw him squatting over 500, benching 400, and deadlifting 605 for all new personal bests! Way to go Pat!! The meets couldn't happen without all the volunteers. Lisa and Arlindo Machado ran the podium and kept things running smoothly. Bill Harney, Deborah Harney and Julie Slanaker were the judges. The spotter loaders were Mike Slenkamp, Roger Fawcett and Toby Spears.
