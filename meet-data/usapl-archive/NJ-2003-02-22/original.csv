This years Ron Falcone Invitational took place at the palatial Lafayette Estates, home to James Benemerito and Jerry Dally. We would like to thank James very much for the use of his home for this meet. It turned out to be one of the better invitationals we have had. We had a mix of lifters from new to very experienced. Anthony Ceglia, Shane Spencer and Billy Dee Williams were all new to the platform and did very well. It was a great pleasure to have the big boys come down from Albany, Sean Culnan and EC Stumpf, to give everybody in attendance a nice show of some impressive lifts. Overall the lifting was good, some shaking off the rust of inactivity and others just trying to see where they stood. Thank you to all the judges, loaders and spotters who showed up and did a great job. We appreciate your time and effort very much. Hope to see everyone at the Ironman in a couple of weeks.
