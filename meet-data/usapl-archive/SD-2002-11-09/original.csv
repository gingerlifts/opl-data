USAPL DAKOTA OPEN POWERLIFTING & BP CHAMPS.

Rapid City was the site of the 2002 Dakota Open Powerlifting & Bench press championship. 
We had a relatively low turnout of 27 lifters, a change from the 50 and 60 lifter turnouts 
we have had lately but those lifters who showed reaped some nice benefits. All lifters 
received a free meet t-shirt, crain's muscle world supplied certificates good for Crain 
power suits, Inzer Advance Designs supplied t-shirts, wraps, and gift certificates which 
were also distributed to lifters via drawings. There was free coffee and fruit in the 
morning and sub sandwiches for lunch for staff and lifters from Albertsons Deli.

Thanks to all the helpers and to all the lifters that did show up. 
Here is our list of sponsors a big thanks to all of them once again!
