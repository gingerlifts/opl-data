It was another successful USAPL North Carolina State meet. This meet continues to grow with quality competitors of all ages. A full power meet was run in conjunction with a bench only meet. Although, the turn out may have been hindered by the meets proximity to USAPL Men's Nationals and Master's Nationals in May, there were over 40 competitors, nearly 60 classes entered, and 6 females. The success of this meet still goes to it's efficient running by all the volunteer help. Thanks goes out to all the table help, spotters, loaders, announcer Tim Morgan, and referees, Glen Hill, John Demchak, and Christy Newman. A special thanks to the sponsors, Bulk Nutrition.com, Inzer Advanced Designs, APT wrist Wraps, Dick's Sporting Goods, and Promax.

The meet was held in three flights, the first flight was female and teens, followed by men's open and then men's masters. In the first flight the opening attempt set the stage for what was to come. Female Youth competitor, 13 year old, Wendi Clewis broke the State Squat Record on her opening attempt on her way to 6 records and a 309lb. total at a mere 101lbs. bodyweight. The Female class, decided by wilks formula, was won by Suzette Ogbon followed closely by Andrea Anderson. Both broke multiple State Records on their way to totaling 623lbs. and 661lbs. respectively. Arlene Libby won Gold in the Female Bench only meet breaking a record on all 3 attempts. The teens followed and continued the record setting trend. Teen 1 class was won by Andrew Hare breaking 7 records and totaling 959lbs, taking the Bench only title as well. In Teen 2 it was Justin Eicholtz winning both Power and Bench meets, finishing with a record 292lb. bench. The Teen 3 class had two separate champions. In full power, it was up and coming, Adam English taking Gold while breaking 6 records. His 1394lb. total would have placed him in the top 5 at last years High School Nationals at 198lbs. and 1st by more than 50lbs. in the 181lb class considering he came in weighing 190lbs. In the Bench only meet it was Brandon Adams capturing the title with a record 309lb. lift.

The second flight was the Men's Open classes. The lightest competitor was Wilbert Jones. Wilbert won the Bench only 114lb. class with a double bodyweight, record setting bench. In the 123lb. class Adam Woods won both Gold's in the Full Power and Bench meets setting a total of 7 State Records. Rob Wess also took both State Titles, in the 148lb class. Open lifter Kevin Locklear, from South Carolina, took the Open 148lb Bench title with a South Carolina record 320lb. bench. Next was the 181lb class. This was the biggest class and had two separate champions. Charlie Kiziah bombed in the squats almost falling twice, but came back dominating for the Bench title with a record 391lb. lift on his opener. The Full Power Gold went to Kurt Sokolski who set a sub master bench record on his way to a 1356lb. total. In the 198lb. class Travis Pardue won both titles. In the Full Power meet he totaled 1527 and walked away with the Best Lifter Award. Although Travis won the state title in the bench he was out done by World Team Member Dennis Cieri, form New Jersey, for the open title. Dennis slimmed down from 220lbs. to 198lbs, after dropping 600lbs. on his chest 6 months ago, looked good. He finished with a bench of 568lbs. and just missed an unofficial IPF World Record and American Record of 584lbs. The 275lb. Gold went to Georgian, Neil Gewirtzman, with the biggest total of the meet 1620lbs. This easily locked up the Best Bencher Award. At 242lbs. another New Jersey boy put up a big number. Troy Lehrer made 540lbs. look easy for the Gold. The biggest bench of the day came from SHW A.J. Coleman Jr. A.J. gave 601lbs. a ride for the title and a State Record.

The experienced guys came last, with the third flight being made up of the master's lifters. It started off with a show of true strength. Masters 7 lifter, 74 year old, 181lb. Bill Milner won the Bench Gold with a record 215lb. bench. The Masters 1 class, figured by wilkes, was a well-contended class. Mark Swift won the state title with a record total of 1466lbs., followed closely be Rob Wess who set a masters bench record. The open title was won however by the man from Georgia, Neil Gewirtzman. The Bench title went to Robert Britt with a 402lb bench followed by Elizer Hinton Jr. with a South Carolina Record Bench of 386lbs. In the Masters 2 Class, Kurt Hall easily won the Full Power meet with 1394lb. total. Kent Walton took second but won the Bench title retuning to lifting after more than 20 years. Masters 3 was the last class of the day and it had a double winner. Wayne Alsup took both titles winning the Bench with a record 375lb lift, and finishing the meet with the biggest pull of the day 650lbs for a new State Record.

Again, this was a very enjoyable meet for all. Starting with gift bags with freebees from our sponsors APT wrist wraps, Promax, and Dick's. Next was a quickly and efficiently run meet, with great support and sportsmanship. Then finally to Battle Axe best lifter awards and free Rage X bench shirts, supplied by Inzer Advanced Designs, for the Bench Meet Winners.
