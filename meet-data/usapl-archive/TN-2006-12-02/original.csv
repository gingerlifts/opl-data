The 2006 Tennessee State Championships and Appalachian Open was a huge success. After a 5 year absence, the USAPL made its return with 11 lifters last year. This year there were almost three times as many with 29 lifters. Not only were the. numbers up but the quality was also good as 6 of the 18 Teens, 2 of the 3 Juniors, and both of the Master lifters qualified for nationals. In the female division there were 2 fine lifters - Jerissa Rice posted a 385 total in her first meet to qualify for high school nationals, and Jessica Porter hit an awesome 885 total at 165 to make it to Juniors. In the light teen flight there were some great male lifters. Mark Hollingsworth qualified for HS nationals with a nice raw 925 total. Logan Birchfield won best Teen lifter with a super 1090 total at 165 and just missed a stupendous 500 pound pull that would have put him well over 1100. He also requalified for HS nationals and seems poised for a podium spot this time. In the heavy Teen flight there was also plenty of noise being made. Charlie Connor lifted all raw in his first sanctioned meet and did not disappoint with a nice 1135 total. Joe Howard was not to be undone with his 1170 total, also at 181. Steven Nease also did some fine lifting right out of football season with a super 500 pound Deadlift, then attempting a huge jump to 585 that was just not to be on this day. All 3 of these young men qualified for HS nationals with their fine performances. The old guys were not to be upstaged and did some fine lifting of their own in the adult flight. Sam Durham won best lifter with his fine first meet performance of 1410 total at just 165. Justin Vitatoe totaled an awesome 1560 raw at 242. Jim Compton came off a severe hamstring tear to hit a nice 600 Squat, 475 BP and just tokened with a 405 Deadlift to qualify for Junior nationals. Mike Nease would not let all the younger guys have all the fun as the Master 2 lifter opened with a stunning 775 Deadlift that was 50 pounds over the American record (it was unofficial here). He then jumped big for the largest Deadlift in in history with 880. He had it within a couple of inches of lockout but just could not finsih it. Steve Caldwell was able to return to the platform after a serious injury, to post a nice Bench and making his way back to the Master nationals. It was a great meet with many first time lifters and some experienced veterans. Thanks to the best back spotter in the business, Jake Jenkins, plus the other spotters and loaders who did a great job! The score table attendants Mark Estep and Mark Norman, did not allow one misload or skipped lifter the entire day. We also thanks three of the finest judges in the business, Doc Holloway, Jennifer Thompson, and Phillip Battle. We hope to see you next year and hopefully we will experience the same type of growth as we saw this year. - Alex Campbell, USAPL TN State Chairman
