The Heavy Metal meet took place at Pro Fitness and was changed to a one day event. The turnout was decent and we would like to thank everyone who showed up and helped with running the meet. There was some good lifting with some lifters trying to qualify for Men's Nationals and a few successfully set American records. David Cohn started things off in the 114 class and set a Missouri state record in the Bench. Mark Richmond looked strong in winning the 165 class with Joe Golbaclose behind. James Benemerito won the 181 class and qualified for Men's Nationals. Billy Dee Williams won the 198 class and Ron Mazza took the 220. It was good to see Larry Thompson back competing and he looked sharp winning the 242 class with some very nice lifting. Matty Clark won the 275 class with his impressive squats leading the way. Chris Lentino won the Juniors and Chris Mauro won the Raw class. Warren Scott came from Pennsylvania and looked very good setting a couple of American records. Congratulations to him and everyone who competed. See ya at the states in November!
