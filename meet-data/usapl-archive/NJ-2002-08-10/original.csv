2002 Pro Fitness NJ Bench Press Open, August 10, 2002

38 enthusiastic lifters took part in this annual summer bench press competition held at Pro Fitness Health Club, Rockaway, New Jersey. The competition ran efficiently with much quality lifting being seen. All divisions were competed by formula except for the open classes. Officiating was firm and consistent as would be expected. In the Women's Division, Shelia Harvey came out of retirement to win over Pro Fitness' Beverly Solerno. Justin Rogers took first place in the Teenage Division beating out Ryan McDonough, the only lifter to make all 3 benches. Mike Ciupinski continues to lift solidly while winning the Junior Division. Bob 'Spike' Dunado won the Submaster Division over three experienced competitors. The Masters Division had the largest number of competitors with 10. IPF Master Bench Press Champion Bill Phillips used this meet as a warm-up for the Bench Press Nationals, continued his winning ways and always benches over 400 lbs. In the Open Division, 148 class was won by Chris Apister over his training buddy Michael Santiago who had some technical issues. Mark Richmond led the 165 class and should do better once he learns the benefit of a tight shirt. Joe DeMotteo looked a little off. Perhaps the stress of his wedding the next weekend took his edge off a wee bit. Rich Kruzsely, Donald Stevenson and Kevin Herbert all lifted well and won the 220, 242, 275 classes respectively. Best Lifter Dennis Cieri was impressive winning the 198 class; Dennis's first attempt was called for being a little short on the pause. Nevertheless, Dennis stuck to his plan to come back strong to hammer the next two attempts. His final attempt was a strong 550 lbs effort, which would unofficially tie the current Bench Press record as I understand it. Thanks to all who helped the meet be a success. Bill Clayton
