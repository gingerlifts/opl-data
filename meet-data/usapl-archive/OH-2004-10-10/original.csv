Even though the turnout was less than last year's state championships, the attendance and quality of the
lifting was excellent. Many state records were set. A Junior American record was set by Phil Delmonte with
a 465 lb Bench Press. Best lifters in the BP competition were Andy Furnas in the Men's Open with a 500 lb
press, and in the Masters with a 500 lb press the award went to Palmo Aracri. In the PL competiton the Best
Lifter award in the Men's Open went to Todd Straub with a total of 1505 lbs in the 165 class. The best Master
lifter went to Palmo Aracri with a 1560 lbs total. The Best Female Lifter was Tiffany Summers with a 1020 lb
total in the 181 class.
Frank and I want to thank all who gave their weekend to help us with the championships. All the judges, score
table pesonnel, concession stand people, loaders and spotters did a fantastic job. Their dedication to the
sport of drug free powerlifting goes above and beyond the call of duty. We would not be able to run these events
if not for their efforts.
On December 3,4 & 5, 2004 we along with Larry Miller will be promoting the IPF World Bench Press Champion-
ships.This is the first time this prestigious competition will be held in the U.S. We estimate 300 to 400 of the
world's top bench pressers to show up. Please call Ed or Frank at (440) 439-5464 if you have any questions or
if you are interested in purchasing a vendor's table. Also the next state championships will most likely be held
December 2005. Please check Powerlifting USA for the listing.
