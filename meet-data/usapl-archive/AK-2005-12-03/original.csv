The 13th Annual Ketchikan Powerlifting Meet saw 11 lifters pushing the iron. There were three first time competitors
and six teens lifting. The meet was broken into three divisions with three female lifters, four male teen lifters and
four male lifters. Two teens set Alaska State records: Joe Peterson at 114 and Margaret Bruce at 181. Four of
them set Ketchikan High School records: Joe and Margaret as well as Elizabeth Harney and Troy Winchester.
Doug Gregg set three state records on his way to Best Male Lifter of the meet. He had a Wilks Age Formula of
943, a personal best.
