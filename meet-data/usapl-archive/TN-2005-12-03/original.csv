The first USAPL state championships in more than 6 years was held in Elizabethton, TN. 
There was a good mix of young and old lifters to get the USAPL off the ground again in TN. 
Of the only 2 Bench competitors, John Bible  won with his raw 430 beating out Alex 
Campbell's 295 opener.

In the full meet, there was lots of great lifting from the high school competitors. 
Jordan Barrett nudged out a win with a total of 735 over Logan Clifton's 585, qualifying 
Jordan for USAPL High School Nationals. Mark Hollingsworth in the 148 class lifted raw 
with a nice total of 780. Logan Birchfield hit a super total of 995, earning him Best Lifter
in the Teen division and qualifies for the High School Nationals. Jeff Evans won the 181 class 
with a good 850 total.

Then Rees Burt followed with a win in the 220 class - he tokened in the Squat due to injury, 
just missed the American record in the BP, then came back to break his previous American DL 
record twice, with 550 and 575. For all teens lifters (except Rees) it was their first sanctioned 
competition. They did a great job and are eagerly training for the next opportunity.

Matt Doty is a promising young lifter who won the 220 Collegiate class with his 1455 total.
In the full Open meet Michael Weller, 165 class, hit a nice Squat before bombing in the BP. 
It was a valiant effort in his first meet after a bicep tear. Jason Robertson took second 
in the 242 class with a nice 1270 total of all raw lifts. Justin Vitatoe won the 242 class 
with a fine 1590 total and Best Lifter award for the Open class. John Bailey also hit a nice 
total of 1130 with raw lifting, winning in the 275 class. SHW John Bible notched nice raw 
Squat and BP. His DL gave him a 1640 total to qualify for Master Nationals. It was a great day 
for powerlifting in TN. 5 teens had their first official competiton with 3 qualified for High 
School Nationals and two American records were broken. In other classes, many enjoyed their 
first USAPL competition, set new PR's and made new friends. As TN USAPL is just starting to 
structure state records, most of the lifts did qualify as records.

I would like to say a special thanks to the the fair and consistent judging of Billy Keel, 
Steve Grubbs and Vincent White. A special thanks also to the the gym owner, Rick Baughman, 
whose facility made this meet possible.

Jake Jenkins, Mickey Hunsinger and Thomas Isaacs did a great job as spotters and loaders, 
making one life-saving grab too. Dr. Keel did a great job running the table along with my 
wife Brittney. Also a big thanks to Nathan Ball for the use of his Ivanko bar.
