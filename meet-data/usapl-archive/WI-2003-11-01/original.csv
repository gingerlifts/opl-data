The 15th annual Hudson Open was a huge success.There were 5 National judges and at 
least 8 State judges in house. As the meet director I really appreciate all the help 
that volunteered to sit in the chairs. Thank you. 4 different officials performed 
the drug testing. 5 lifters were tested. As always, I was concerned about having enough 
help to do a great job at spotting and loading all day, but the crew did an excellent job.
Many of the helpers weren't even powerlifters but very competent at their job and very 
willing to lend a hand wherever needed. Looking at the numbers hoisted that day you can 
see why good help is priceless. We had many competing that lifted in the National and World 
competition, and others that I'm sure will lift in National and World competitions in the future.
This was the second year of the "Border Battle" between Minnesota and Wisconsin. Since Hudson 
is on the border, this is a fitting name for the informal battle. Last year MN won. With the 
help of many National class lifters we edged out WI by 7 Wilks points. The award went to WI 
by a sizable margin. The lifters of Peshtigo will hang the trophy in their gym until next 
year's battle. Great job Wisconsin! 
Another welcome sight was the number of young lifters from the Wisconsin High School 
Powerlifting program. It's great to see these lifters learning that there really is 
powerlifting  beyond high school.
