The 2002 USAPL Iron Man Bench/Deadlift took place Saturday March 16th at ProFitness gym in Rockaway, NJ. The turnout was a little lighter than in previous years but the lifting was still very good. The event started with a few token squats that were taken by those who needed totals and also looking to set some records. The benches started off with Anna Sheder who was competing in her first contest. After some jitters on her first attempt she settled down and looked good in her next attempts. The Submasters had some very good benches led by Dane Robinson's strong 518, which won the class and the best bench award for the day. Charlie Neal set a NJ submaster's record with a nice 462 bench. The master's class also had some good benching. Bill Phillips (198 lbs) led the way in the class with an amazing 391 bench at age 64. Lloyd Weinstein returned to the platform and completed a nice 3 for 3 in the bench ending with an easy 292. He is prepping for the upcoming Master's Nationals. Jeff Jacobs also came back and hit an easy 275 @ 159 pounds. Jeff is also hoping to be at the Master's Nationals this year. The Open classes saw Brian Burritt win the 198's with a nice 402 and Wayne McGhee win the 220's with a 435 in his first meet. The Deadlifts started with Beverly Salerno, who was also competing in her first meet, going 3 for 3. The Master's class was entertaining with Randy Titus winning the class by formula. Charles Slaybaugh won the best Deadlift award for the day eding out his brother Chet. Dave Penn won the 148's with a nice 424, Dave Picard won the 198's with a 529 pull. Rich Kruszsely won the 220's and Matthew Gatzke went 3 for 3 to win the 242 class. Darren Nemow pulled 622 @ 256 lbs bodyweight to win the 275's. Thanks goes out to all the spotters, judges and loaders who helped make the event run quickly and smoothly.
