This event featured 70 lifters who came from the following states: MA, RI, CT, NH, ME and NJ. The lifting was excellent once again as the results will attest to the quality of the lifters who compete in the USAPL. This event featured a split session on Saturday with one flight in the morning and the other flight in the afternoon. Even lifters who came by themselves had no problem having a fellow lifter assist them with their gear with words of encouragement during their attempts. This is what separates the USAPL events from others. As one can see by the results, we had a large number of teenage contestants. It's great to see that High School and Teenage Powerlifting is making a comeback in the New England area. After Howie Waldron's retirement from running the MA High School PL program, there was a severe downturn in these categories. Howie ran very successful and very popular meets for at least twenty years and is sorely missed. Eric Cordeiro however stepped up to the plate and now has revitalized the High School and Teenage program in the New England area for the past three years. Eric has also done a fantastic job with our website www.newenglandusapl.com which features records, coming events, results and many other useful links.
Thanks again to Rene Moyen and Next Level Fitness for hosting yet another successful event. Thank you also to Mike of Northeast Fitness for the continued use of his facility. Thanks to all of the judges, spotters, loaders, table help and everyone else who assisted with hosting this event. And of course, thanks to all of the lifters who continue to support our USAPL events - these meets are for you! Last but definitely not least, thanks to our sponsors, the Mayor of Warwick, RI, Mike Lambert Powerlifting USA, John Inzer and Cambridge Sound Works for their generous contributions in helping to make our event as successful as it was.
God Bless - Yours In Powerlifting - Greg Kostas
