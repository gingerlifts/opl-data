Sometime In August my lovely wife Gina asked me what I wanted to do for my 40th birthday. When I said I'd like to put on my first powerlifting meet and I would like to have it our garage, she looked at me like I was insane. I knew she was thinking that that because she said "You're crazy!" I'm observant about these things.

When she realized I was serious (and that it would only be a small meet) she put her game face on and helped me get everything ready to go. Without her this whole thing never would have happened. Well it would have happened but the house would have looked like crap and everyone would have starved since I would have forgotten to go to the store to buy food.

Fortunately, the 1st annual Bullseye Barbell Invitational went off with out a hitch in sunny Aurora Oregon. Mainly, we put on this inaugural event on very short notice in order to qualify a few friends for national level meets. My garage gym was just big enough to handle everyone, thankfully it didn't rain on us. Well, not too much anyway. We only had to move the scorers table twice I think.

There were no trophies and no entry fees, just guys who wanted to lift for its own sake. Some hit the totals, some missed it by a bit but everyone had a good time I think.

Brad Coury celebrated his return to the platform after major shoulder surgery, got his gear dialed in and showed that everything is back on track (except for his squat but he doesn't want to talk about that). With less than a year of training, Alex The Hammer Carp put up some very nice numbers at 198 and 20 years old, hitting PR's in the squat, bench and total. Alex went for a PR deadlift of 520 and just hitched it at the top, he'll get that and more next time.

Also in his first meet back since major surgery (ruptured triceps) Kevin Stewart lifted at 249 bodyweight and squatted 700, then he benched 500 and pulled 685. Kevin was in a motorcycle wreck a week before the meet, and he thought he was just bruised up a bit. A week after the meet Kevin called me and told me that he had broken his hip in the motorcycle wreck. He did a 1890 total on three attempts with a broken hip.

You read that correctly. An 1890 total with a broken hip! He did this after staying up half the night frying about 12,635,958 chicken legs which was enough to keep everyone pretty well fed until dinner time.

Andrew Snider made the drive up from Klamath Falls and bombed in the bench, but I think he still had a good time and hopefully he'll come up here more often and train with us. Justin Behnke lifted with 1 week notice after taking the summer off. He was stronger than I thought he would be and got his 400 bench on his third attempt. Thanks to Mike Mooney and Lizzy, Rich, Rhonda, Robert and Wayne.

Special thanks to John Inzer who helped deck out the lifters (relax, not Kevin and Liz yet......but I'm working on them lol!) in the finest powerlifting gear available!

Since this is a family publication, I won't get into what happened after the meet too much but suffice it to say it went on well into the next morning. For those that are interested, yes I do have pictures and no you can't see them!

We had enough room for everyone that wanted to to crash at the house, so the next day we had a squat workout in the garage. I can't say I've ever had a better birthday party.
