2004 USAPL NEW JERSEY STATE POWERLIFTING CHAMPIONSHIPS

Pro Fitness Powerlifting Team & Health Club once again had the honor & pleasure of hosting USAPL NJ Powerlifting Championships on November 6, 2004 in Rockaway, NJ.

NJ was one of the original signers of the ADFPA (now USAPL) constitution. This state championship has occurred annually without missing a year going back to 1983. It may well be the longest, consecutively held state championship in ADFPA/USAPL organization and the country. Many of nearby states and New Jersey's finest lifters have used this meet as preparation to go on to successfully compete at national and international level meets. As in the past, this years forty two lifters competed well and showed the kind of sportsmanship that has become a part of this competition.

James Golba, Matt Krimsky, Jason Louder & Jim Weiss all lifted well and took home NJ state titles. In the 181, the new & still much lighter Daren "Captain" Nemow fended off John Dalessio to win the title. The 198s saw the return of two lifters who had not been competing in some time. Doug Chin, formally of Vermont and now a master lifter, edged Michael Moylen to take the title via having the lighter bodyweight. In the 220's, John Rosinski & Rich Krusely both of Pro Fitness battled with John winning out to take the state title home.

The Women lifters at this meet were a spirited group. Ellen Stein made a guest appearance, lifted well without taxing herself too much. Katrina, Dana & Erika all lifted soundly making the most of their attempts and lifting well.

The divisions were all competed by formula. Jack Wolff did himself well by winning the Masters division with 6 strong, younger lifters chasing him for the title. Kenneth Lair, James Brown, Brian Conover, Anthony Cavello added (in order) the Sub-master, Raw, Teen, Lifetime titles to their hardware collections. Jeff Schwertman lifted well to take the Juniors division.

The Out of State Divisions saw some quality lifting as well. Chris Dippre totaled 1925lbs. with a 804lbs squat to keep Tom Price behind him. Janel Brown won the Women's Out of state division competing against the continually improving Andrea Avery.

The best bench award went to Pro Fitness' own Rich Kruzsely by a narrow edge over Darren Nemow. Chris Dippre, after a fair amount of suspense getting a squat in, took home the three additional awards-the best squat, best deadlift & best lifter awards.

State records were set by the following individuals: Katrina Marmion, Dana Mauriello, Erika Olsen, Bryan Conover, Jeff Schwerdtman, Jack Wolff and Jim Weiss.

I'd like to take time to thank the following individuals who volunteered their time to make this meet a success. Craig Safran, Brian Callahan, Jerry Dally, Charlie Neal, Eric Grossbeck, James Benemerito, John Corsello, Mike Rosenwald, Jules Pelligrino, Ron Falcone, Artie Marguiles, Mike Ciupinski, Kimberly Walford, Jeff Walker, Beverly Salerno, Gino, Gina, Pepe & Debbie for the pictures Joe & the staff at Pro Fitness. As always, please excuse me if I missed mentioning someone who helped as it is unintentional.

One other note: Mike Rosenwald will be moving to Arizona shortly. Mike was given an award, a couple Pro Fitness shirts, etc., to thank him for his devotion to helping out at the meets over the past few years. He'll be missed in NJ & will certainly be Arizona's gain. We wish Mike well. Bill Clayton
