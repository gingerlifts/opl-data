Hudson Natural Open Best Lifter  1st Session
Kyle Milnes
Hudson natural Open Best Lifter   2nd Session
Justin Nelson






        The 2010 Hudson Natural Open was a great success. We had novice, first time lifters as well as many veteran lifters. The meet  has evolved into more of a Raw competition than a geared competition, with over 70% of the competitors lifting Raw. Because of this, we had to change the way that the Wisconsin/Minnesota Border Battle is determined. Using a percentage of Raw and a percentage of Geared lifters, Wisconsin came out on top for the Border Battle award.
        Kyle Milnes was very impressive on his way to winning the Best lifter award in the first session of lifting. Kyle made a very impressive 775  Squat in the Raw Men’s division. I don’t even think he wears a belt for Squats, and seems to be one of those people that always has great depth in the lift. Justin Nelson did an outstanding job in earning the best lifter award for the 2nd session of lifting. Justin proved to be a force in all three lifts. 400 lb. Bench weighing in at only 145.9 lbs.? Wow!
        Sid Ried was the best of the best in the Raw Men Master’s age 50 and above division. He is always one of the lifters to watch at a Powerlifting event.
        I could go on and on about the great people that make this long running meet a success. Lifters, Judges, Spotters/Loaders, announcers, and the fans in the audience make this a fun event for all. We are already making plans for the 23rd annual Hudson Natural Open.
