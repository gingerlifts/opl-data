This meet saw two lifters, Trevor Eubanks and Taylor Gregg, setting all new K-High records for their respective
age and weight class. Andrew Wolford, the 3rd teen lifter from POW, made his first appearance with a solid
performance in all 3 lifts. We hope he'll be back for the Spring Record Breakers. POW also sent Tom Wolford
and Jim Silverthorne to compete in the Open Men's competition. Jim ad Tom are becoming veterans and both
had their best performances capped with 500 lb plus attempts in the Deadlift. Tom just missed his and Jim
pulled 505 lbs. Floyd Frank, Pat Stack and Missy Goodwin training together at the Get Fit Stay Fit Gym,
continued the gym's tradition as the backbione of the powerlifting community in Ketchikan. Missy, in her
first meet, showed great technique and potential for even better performances in the future. It is great to see
a new female to add to our history of female competitors. Pat had his personal bests in every lift, increasing
his total a whopping 85 lbs over the May meet and gaining him best lifter honor. Floyd, owner/operator of
Floyd's Carpentry, one of our meet sponsors and part of the legendary Ketchikan Masters team, had a solid
performance. Pat is going to have to train hard to stay ahead of Floyd who consistently totals high even while
getting older! Ketchikan Powerlifting once again thanks Lisa and Arlindo Machado. They have been
instrumental to our community program: Lisa as a long time meet director, Arlindo on podium stats, and both
with financial support whenever it is needed. They volunteer at every meet and are willing to do anything
between meets to make the next meet happen. A thank you also goes to Bob Hewitt, Bill Harney and Doug
Gregg for judging, and Greg Middag, Charlie Jones and Ben Martin for loading and spotting. Our next meet
should be the first week of March - stay tuned for details!
