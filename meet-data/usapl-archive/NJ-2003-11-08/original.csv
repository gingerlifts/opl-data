This meet was held at Pro Fitness. The NJ State Champion Meet is one the longest annual meets held in
the USAPL. NJ was one of the original states to sign off on the ADFPA constitution. I've been involved with
the meet since 1982 and have had the priviledge of witnessing much quality lifting in that time. This year's
event was no exception. Theresa Kunsman and Beverly Salerno represented women lifters, winning in their
division. Joe Bagnato and Chris Lentino won the Teen & Junior classes, respectively. Lydon Samuels lifted
well, winning the RAW division. Jack Wolf took the Masters division. Several NJ state records were set -
Bev Salerno, Mark Richmond, Ron Falcone, Scope, Jim & Jack Weiss. Jack Weiss's records are also
American records. Mark Richmond set the Open BP record for 165 and qualified for Open Nationals. Matt
Babin lifted well to take the 181's. Darren Nemow who has gone from a 242 class to 198, won that class over
veteran Ron Falcone. This is Ron's 20th year at this meet and his reward was a new Masters BP record and
some PR's. Krzysztof Ksepka lifted solidly and took the 220's. The 242's saw a return of 'Scope', now a
Master setting a couple of NJ Master records and he took a couple of cracks at an 800 lb Squat. Matt Clark,
who always looks strong, won the 275's and Jim Weiss took the Super's prize. Best Squat award went to
Scope, best Bench to Mark Richmond and Krzysztof Ksepka took home best Deadlift award. Overall best
lifter was Matt Clark. Gino did his usual entertaining job of announcing. Craig Safran, Brian Callahan, and
Joe DeMatteo did a great job of keeping things moving along. Jeff Walker and John Corsello manned the
score table. Charlie Schroeder, Jules Pelligrino, Mike Rosenwald, Geoff Plante help with refereeing. The Pro
Fitness staff all contributed in making the meet a success. Please excuse if I missed anyone who helped out.
