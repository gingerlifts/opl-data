2005 USAPL New Jersey State
High School Bench Press Championships

New Jersey Hillsborough High School boys and girls Raiders Powerlifting team was the winner of this year's 2005 USAPL NJ High School Bench Press Championships. In second place was Toms River High School in Toms River NJ who posted very strong results.

Hillsborough High School in New Jersey held the first USAPL High School Bench Press Championships on April 17, 2005. Jim McFarland HHS Strength Coach and Mark Salandra life time ADFPA/USAPL member sponsored this meet to start promoting Powerlifting to the age group of 14 to 18 year olds in New Jersey. The contest was a huge success with a total of 20 lifters 18 boys and 2 girls and 2 teams Hillsborough High School and Toms River High School competing for Strongest High School in New Jersey.

Best Female Lifter from Hillsborough High School who was in the Freshman/Sophmore division at 15 years of age was Angela Davia lifting 50 kilos or 110lbs in the Bench Press. Best lifter in the Male category was Neil Rigney from Toms River High School in the Senior division 165lb weight class lifting 147.5 kilo's or 325lbs. Bruce Harper from the NY Jets was onsite to address the audience and to talk about how good health and strength and conditioning helped him become a professional NFL player and how important it is for children to grow up and be great citizens not only good athletes.

We would like to thank all our sponsors, judges, spotters and volunteers for not having their help we would never have been able to hold such a fun and successful competition. A special thanks to Bill Clayton NJ USAPL Chairman who was there each step of the way to make sure we had everything we needed to hold this competition.
