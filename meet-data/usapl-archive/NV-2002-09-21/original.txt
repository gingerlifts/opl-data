NV State PL & BP Championships

All I can say is that it was awesome. We made the front page of the newspapers in Elko NV all week and in Reno NV and in Salt Lake City. We had one of the best lifters that you could ever see. Her name is Effie Nielson, she is 90 years old and she set American records in Squat 80 lbs, Bench Press 50 lbs and Deadlift 135 lbs. Total 265 lbs. We need to check this might even be a World Record? Also David Letterman had a crew at the meet recording it and it is going to be on October 02, 2002. They are flying Effie and some of her family to New York to be on the show live. She said she is coming back next year. Also on a great note CBS is going to be there to record it and put it on the air next year. They said that they love all the things that we are doing over here and they want to get involved. They said this kind of event is awesome. Also we have Shirley Haycock, she is 68 years old, she is here every year and has broken her American Records 27 times. We also had a bunch of state records that got broken. We are just excited for next year because the coverage we had this year. Everybody wants to get involved - CBS, ESPN, all the newspapers - NV, UT, ID, MT, OR, WA, CA, AR, CO. Everybody is still calling and we love it.
Thanks for everything
Jim Kralich
