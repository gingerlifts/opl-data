The 2006 MD State Chamionships was held for the first time at the Student Union building 
of Anne Arundel Community College in Arnold, Maryland. The lifting area was roomy, well 
ventilated and able to hold many spectators. The warm-up area was in a separate room where 
the lifters could see all that was going on at the platform. Besides the help and assistance 
of the Bardsley family (Jim, James, Brenda) we had an outstanding crew of referees, spotters,
loaders, announcers, and runners. The lifters ranged from 19 years young to 80 years young! 
Many records (state) were set and many PR's were set too.

It was a great meet and we hope to hold the next Maryland State Championships at this same 
place in 2007.
