The First Annual Fife Power Company
Push/Pull Holiday Classic

Look Here for Contest Photos

First and foremost my hearty appreciation needs to go out to all the USAPL fraternity here in Washington for allowing us to be involved with some very class people. I don't think we would have pulled this off without them. Our first try at a meet and once we got it underway it went very smoothly.

A very special thanks to all the volunteers who make these things happen. These folks include two who helped me keep my sanity while putting this together as well as still coach my kids. Kevin Stewart and Dean Reece were just monumental at helping keep it together. Kevin brought his platform and weights as well as his experience and Dean brought his expertise on the platform and organizational ideas. Without these guys I don't think the kids of the Fife Power Company would still be in existence. Kevin has more then once come to help all the kids in my classes on his own dime. It has been a blast and that is why I tried doing this and stay with this sport.

More kudos to Roger (Silver Medalist at the Masters Worlds) and Lea Hendrix, Ryan Stills, Paula Houston (Gold Medalist at the Masters Worlds), Roger Silva and Dick Schuller (Silver Medalist at the Masters Worlds) for all their loading, spotting and officiating. To Lea for all the pictures and getting this out to lifting fans. These folks are not just World Class lifters they are great people spending a Saturday morning helping out. To Ronda Stewart and Kailey Waters at the scorers table. And to all the Fife School District volunteers who showed up to help and their only payment was the meet TShirt (a good looking one at that), especially my principal John McCrossin who got recruited to help the scorers table. When the call goes out our staff jumps forward. Our local Starbucks brought Jo to Go for all the volunteers and our shirts were designed by Xpress Imprints. More kudos to the fantastic folks at Inzer. I ordered some basic gear to get my kids going and they were just awesome with their help. The budget was small, but hopefully all had a great time. Maybe the results speak for themselves.

The women went first with all of them stepping to the fore to start the day. Two of the Fife girls are former best lifters in their first meets and they stayed the course this day. Kelsey McFarland (105 16-17) has six state records at 105 and 114 and Bri Whitney (114 18-19) has two state records at 114. They didn't break any today, but showed well on a short training cycle. Newcomers Alicia Adams (123 16-17) and Alison Stewart (148 16-17) joined other veteran Fife girls Devon Franklin (weighing 142 but lifting 165 today and setting a State Record in the bench) and Ali McWeeny (8 state records @ 132/148 14-15/16-17), who tied a state record in the bench, on the platform and veteran Patricia Tidmarsh @ 123. Teri Gack was equally awesome @ 165 for the women.

We followed with the Teen, Juniors and Open Men. Up first was Jeff Collins of the Fife team at 132 14-15 in his first meet and setting a state bench record. Then came some outstanding lifting by Travis Belen of Shelton at 148. Travis set two new state records today with a 281 bench and a 391 dead lift and he is only 15. Jeremiah Flynn of the Fife team came in @ 181 (18-19) was lifting in his first meet and hit 176 in the bench and 324.5 in the dead lift. Jeff Krupp of the Fife team was in his first meet also @ 181 (16-17) and had a tough day in the bench, but we let him lift through and he dead lifted 379.5. Doug Kohls ( that was his mom with the coffee) also lifted in his first meet @ 165 (16-17) hitting 143 and 302 which isn't bad for a very tall guy.. Chris Schaefer came home from college to lift with his old teammates, but moving up a weight class to 165 and in the Junior division lifting 187 and 374 on three weeks training! Alan Tepper was our only Masters lifter at 60 years of age in the 181 class and he hoisted 275 and 324.5. Troy Hake drove up from Oregon and lifted at a raw 181. He benched 303 today. Sean Miller of the Fife team entered @ 198 (16-17) for his first meet and had a very good day lifting 225 and pulling a very big 501 in the dead. Andre Bohall of the Fife team entered his second meet @ 198 (18-19)and set two state records. Andre benched 259 and 479.5 before taking a big jump to 529. It broke ground, but he couldn't pull through. Fife Power Company teammates Drew Sullivan and Gerardo Ruiz lifted at 220 (18-19) with Drew benching 215 and dead lifting a mighty 501 and Gerardo benching 215 and dead lifting 452. Youngster Cody Pollock of the Fife team came in @ 242 (16-17)with fine lifts of 231 and 446 in the dead lift before missing at 501. Newcomer Jayson Kline was also @ 242 (18-19). Jayson benched a fine 303 and pulled a very good 556. He had one fine meet. Ken Gack and Mark Knight (Fife's vice principal) toed the line at 242. Ken had a great day benching 452 and finishing with a mighty 601 dead lift. That one got some wows! Mark was in his first meet and also had a great day. He benched 292 (his best training lift a year ago was 230) and he dead lifted 474 with his best training lift a year ago at 340 (must be his training partner!). You don't want to get sent to his office! Tony Waters led the guys at 275 in the Open division. Tony also had a terrific day with a bench of 353 and a dead lift of 529. Both those lifts brought huge smiles to his face and his wife Kailey's whom I recruited to help at the score table. Jake Afoa is a former Fife Power Company guy who came into the 275+ Class. Jake hoisted 320 in the bench and hammered a 557 in the dead lift on very limited training.

Best Female Lifter was Patricia Tidmarsh and the Best Male was Ken Gack. Best Teen Female Kelsey McFarland (her second there in her third meet) and Best Teen Male was Travis Belen.

All in all it went very well for our first meet and the plan next year is to make it a full meet, but keep the Holiday Classic theme and even keep the Santa hat on the lifter on the shirt.
