We had several lifters qualify for National Championship competition. Master lifter Jan Froeschle qualified for Women's Masters and Women's Open Nationals, 2003 Worlds Strongwomen competitor and part time powerlifter Liane Blyn qualified for Women's Open Nationals. It would be scary to see what Liane could do if she concentrated on the powerlifts. High school junior Chelsi Mundy qualified for Women's Teen and High School Nationals. First time competitor Joe Gragula qualified for the Master's Nationals and junior lifter Shilo Liabe qualified for the Men's Junior Nationals. High school lifter Briana Greene established the Women's T2 State records n the Squat, Bench, Deadlift, and total. Briana had never seen a Powerlifting meet before the day of the competition. Not bad for learning on the run the day of the meet. I would also like to thank the lifters who traveled from out of state. Sasha Meshkon traveled in from California. Former ADFPA open and world champion and long time friend Bill Schmidt came in from North Caroline. Andy Watson has traveled from Las Vegas to several of our meets now and we look forward to him returning in the spring. I would also like to thank Nicholas Miceli for making the trip from Tucson. Nick competed for the first time in the USAPL last spring. It's a commitment like Nicks that will make Powerlifting grow throughout the state. We also had several lifters new to the USAPL. Briana Greene, Mark Brown, Shilo Liabe, Chris Lloyd, Joseph Gragula, Damien Wadekamper, and Kevin Conlogue. Damien had to fight through some injuries to be able to compete but will be more than ready next time around. Kevin has only been training for Powerlifting for a couple of months and has yet to try any gear. Queen Creek High School and Coach Todd Workman deserve a big thank you. The venue was perfect and the help that Coach Workman provided to assist with the setup, spot, load and teardown was second to none. The loaders even provided their assistance in the warm-up room. As Bill Schmidt put it, I've never competed in a meet where I didn't even have top load a bar in the warm-up room. I would also like to thank Tim McClellan for announcing. Tim was a long time member of the ADFPA, National referee, and the first world team coach for the ADFPA. Also meet director for several Lifetime National Championships, along with the Collegiate National Championships. My partners who have been a large part of building the USAPL back up in the state. John Pena and M2 2004 National Champion Jim Sullivan. Also Lanette Lopez for really showing us the administrative ropes the day of the meet. Lastly the sponsors, Titan Support systems; not only does Pete make great equipment he is a true supporter of the sport, Mike Lambert and Powerlifting USA, And Gary Lewellan with rebuild II. Rebuild II has been a very popular supplement among NFL and NBA teams and is slowly making its way into the strength sports. You can get more info on rebuild II at www. rebuildii.com
