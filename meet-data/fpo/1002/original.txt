The result of an overseas, yesterday's Rock Powerlifting race 

-100kg Juha Someroja 1102,5kg (420-342,5-340) 
-140kg Jonas Rantanen 1220kg (520-360-340) 
-140kg Matti Lehto 1050kg (430-265-355) 
-125kg Jari Rosendahd 970kg (370-270-330) (117kg) The icebreaking 

balance was two of the hardest in the race and especially when only Jonas only got started in every race. 550kg squat was the third really close to succeed and 360kg bets dripped from the dots in the finish position :( 
. Anyway Jonas bundles hard The bad guys in the day, and do not miss out on the one who is currently the very best -140kg lifter in the world. 
Somp's staggering bench 342.5kg does not leave anybody in the box and somehow certainly missed a lot, as the +1130 result was more than close ... Even Somp's acrophatic extracts in the squat were reopened while the jockeys took a ski jump position with 440k.  : Wink: 
Also Jari Rosendahl's return to the 1.5 After the year it was nice to follow and really fast (1,5k), I think that a very good balance, only 117kg, and the 110kg series will be the "home" of rooshi.
