"As always, Bill Crawford and the Metal Militia put on an incredible meet. The meet ran smooth with only a few discrepancies, which were handled well.",,,,
"Bill C. was an awesome host, supporting all the lifters under the bar, from the chicks to the filthiest and largest bastards in the place.",,,,
There were a lot of huge numbers going up. The 4th flight was an absolute freak fest. I have never seen so many 700+ pound benches in one meet.,,,,
"I took several photos and tried to post as many lifters as I could. The lifters with pics are underlined, and you can just click on the name to see the pics. If I have missed you and you'd like to send me a pic of the meet to post, I'd be honored to use it. You can email it to me at meets@ironasylumgym.com",,,,
