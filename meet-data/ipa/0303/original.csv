"As always, Carl supplied kick ass trophies."
"If you are interested in hooking up with Skullptures by Seeker, you can email seeker4@verizon.net"

Big lifts for the day were Denny Martins's 575 lb. bench and Andy Brown's 700 lb. deadlift.
 
 

"Music was supplied by Likwid Lowd Mouth. These guys are really incredible. They played an awesome variety of rock. Adam Dase is the lead singer, and he is joined by Rick Bouch (drums), Shawn Bremil (lead guitar), Shawn Nickles (rythym guitar) and Brad Johnson on bass, who competed in the deadlift . They attend Kane High School, and come with a huge Iron Asylum seal of approval. You guys really rock. If you're in the area and need a band, give Adam a call at (814) 366-0234 or email him at"
