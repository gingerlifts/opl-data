Bench
"Adirondack Barbell seems to host some incredible meets, and this one certainly confirmed that. It was a long ass day with some huge lifts."
"    The judging was top notch with Gene Rychlak, Mark Chaillet, John Zemken and Lance Loganbill, to represent the IPA at it's best."
    Several people stepped up to help the spotting and loading. There certainly is never a lack of comraderie and support at any Metal Militia gathering. Good people supporting a good cause.
"Skullptures by Seeker brought out an amazing sampling of sculptured trophies, along with best lifter swords and battle axes. "
"Julie Scanlon completely blew everyones mind in the full power, totaling an amazing 1431. She is certainly a cool individual as well as being freaky fucking strong."
"Cassy ""Tall Girl"" Seymour impressed the hell out of me with her 710 total in a full meet. She has come a long way after overcoming back injuries. It's great to see her competing."
"Shannon Parish put on an awesome display of full power with a 905 total. I hesitate to call anyone competing under 114 lbs a freak, but man.....is there another word? Holy shit!"
"Janet ""Filthy Mouth"" Faraone benched an awesome 285 pr. She gave 305 one hell of a ride as well, and this was done at 118 lbs. She never ceases to amaze me. I wanna be just like Janet when I grow up."
"Newmans Gym was well represented with Butch Smith hit a 1905 total which gave him a pr in any weight class he's competed (Butch is competing as a little man these days). Joe Wargo hit a nice bench pr, and totaled 1730. Joe Border, Newman's bench king, benched 530."
"Kyle Millheiser totaled 2000 in the big three, really impressive lifting on his part. Brain Crow had a nice total of 1715 in the 165 class. Both these guys put on an awesome display of power."
"Bobby Fields made a bench press comeback, putting up a huge 705. Great to see the Freak back in the game. This man is an incredible representation of the sport."
"Joe Mazza, impressive as always, benched a huge 530 in the 165 class. David Kirschen put up a nice 425. Ron Daly, not letting the upcoming elbow surgery deter him (well, that and his bout with Cat Scratch Fever), benched an awesome 485 @ 181."
"The 198 Pro class was brutal. As said by Carl Seeker, ""Where else but a Militia meet does a 560 bench in the 198's take third?""."
"Shawn Lattimer ended the day with a huge 780 bench. This guy's personality is as impressive as his bench. Great guy, with a freaky bench."
"The meet ended with some socializing at Bill C's Bar, and endless hours of drinking afterward. I got to know Tina Seeker a little better and I ended up with a huge hangover on Sunday. I'll never do that again....heh heh heh...til next time anyhow."
"The meet certainly was successful. Bill raised some money for a wonderful cause, and some really cool people hooked up on a really cool day in Glens Falls, NY."
"It got to be a long day, and we all got pretty exhausted, but would we do it again??? Hell yeah! That's what it's all about!"
