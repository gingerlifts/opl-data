"I don't think we could have asked for a better turnout for our first meet. What a great variety of lifters we had. Lots of teens, pros, masters, and plenty of deadlifters. We'd like to thank everyone who came out to lift, and those who came out to help and to support the meet. We had some great friends there with us.",,,,
"Usually I would use this space for a write up on the meet, but I think it's more important to give credit where credit is due. We'd like to thank the following people.",,,,
"21st Century Fitness in Amsterdam, NY. Chris Wilbur has been supportive of Zane and I since the first time we met him. When we told him we were hosting a meet, he immmediately wanted to know how he could be involved. He owns a fitness center just a few miles from us, at which Zane and I have both trained.",,,,
"Andy's Sales & Serivce in Fonda, NY. Andy Minicki builds custom bikes. He also supports powerlifting. Does it get any better than that? He is a cool guy that was also very anxious to help out.",,,,
"Auctions by HogEye in Tribes Hill, NY. Sponsoring an awesome venue for the meet, and supporting us 1000%. This is our family business, and we were happy to have them as part of the CandyAzz Classic. Zane's parents came out to watch Kerri lift, and ended up staying the entire day.",,,,
Animal Pak. The amazing line developed by Universal Nutrition. The M-Stak and Animal Pak are my personal favorites. These products have done so much for strength sports.Their site is loaded with excellent supplements and hardcore training gear.,,,,
"Fit Happens in Johnstown, NY. Mike Barker owns a personal training and fitness studio that is just minutes away from us. He was very enthusiastic about our meet and looks forward to promoting powerlifting in the future.",,,,
"Fortified Iron. WOW! Do you suppose when Jay Nolan started discussing an idea of a website with Kyle Coleman, that he could have ever imagined what it would become. A kick ass website with the fastest growing forum on the internet! They have an incredible site with articles, pictures and a helpful forum. You can do some serious shopping there as well.",,,,
"Hilltop Collision of Glen, NY. Roger Savoie is a master of bodywork. Noone likes a fender bender, but if you are unfortunate enough to have one, then this is the guy you wanna see.",,,,
"House of Pain Iron Wear. These guys have been ther to support lifters and meets for many years. They have a killer website with a great line of clothing, gear and virtually all of your lifting needs. They truly are lifters for lifters and deserve all of our support!",,,,
"Inzer Advanced Designs. Another leader in powerlifting apparel, and always willing to support the lifters and meet promoters.",,,,
"Karins Xtreme Power Wear. Well we all know that these are the best shirts in the business, with the best customer service available. Easy to deal with and eager to please. Check them out and let them hook you up with some serious gear!",,,,
"Market Street Pizza of Johnstown, NY. Derek and Lisa are the best. They have supported us since the very begining. They happen to be magicians with a pizza pie as well. If you were at the meet, you had the opportunity to sample their expertise. Hopefully you can stop by to try the rest of their menu as well.",,,,
"Metal Militia, Adirondack Barbell of Glens Falls, NY. The bench press may not have been invented here, but it certainly was perfected here. If you want to experience the very best training for the bench, stop by their site and pick up a training video, or sign up for a seminar. You can pick up a tee while you are there, or see when their next meet will be held. It has been an honor to befriend such an awesome caliber of people as Bill and Sebastian. Thanks for all your training advice, but more so for your friendship.",,,,
"Nazareth Barbell of Tatamy, PA. The first time I met Deb Ames and Mike Miller, I knew I had encountered two extremely cool individuals. Mike & Deb manage to maintain an excellent gym facility, phenomenal powerlifting careers, as well as a family. Zane and I truly admire people who can pull that off. Thanks for all your help Deb! You're the best!",,,,
"Skullptures by Seeker. Well if you want the most incredible trophies available, you need to hook up with Carl Seeker. Here is another bunch that Zane and I met, and could not have imagined finding such great friends. Carl is a brother, whom which we could never say enough good things about. ",,,,
"Sowle Industrial Hardware of Gloversville, NY. What started 102 years ago as a little hardware store on Main Street has grown into 7 different divisions to serve all your needs in sandblasting, painting, tractor-trailer repair, auto body supply, hardware & mill supply, along with trucking and fabrication.",,,,
"Total Image Health Club of Perth, NY. Bryan and Amy are relatively new to the gym industry, being in business about a year. They have a great health club, with lots of equipment and services to offer. They have some great plans for bodybuilding shows. They also have a huge storage business.",,,,
