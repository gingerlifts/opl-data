A 10 hour drive would normally be a pain in the ass. This meet would have to be the exception. Lance and Nita Gayle are incredible meet directors. Everything ran very smooth and we had a fabulous time.
"There were plenty of impecable judges available for all the lifts, including Mark Chaillet, the IPA president, Gene Rychlak, the man who holds the massive 900 lb benchpress record, Carl Seeker, of Skullptures by Seeker fame, Bill Crawford & Sebastian Burns of the Metal Militia, Kyle Robertson, who put up an insane 605 bench, and ofcourse Lance Loganbill of Blue Ridge Barbell, who hosted this event."
"    Several people stepped up to help the spotting and loading. Ronnie Shirley was there for this as well as coaching his lifters. Amy Vaughan helped Carl Seeker out at the head table. The boys and their ladies from Granite City were there to support the meet, and I finally got to meet the notorious Pickle Chick. There certainly is never a lack of comraderie and support at an IPA meet. Good people supporting a good cause. "
"    After the meet, Bill Crawford held a bench seminar. We watched a guy that benched 475 in the full power hit a 495 double at the seminar. That should be plenty of reason to hook up with Bill for a seminar."
"    The filthy Sebastian Burns and the Tall Girl, Cassy Seymour video taped the entire meet.....every single lift. You can pick up a video by contacting Sebastian at metalmilitiabench@yahoo.com.   "
