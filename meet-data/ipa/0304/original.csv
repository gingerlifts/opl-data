Some shady characters
Buster...what can I say man.....you sure are an easy target.
Wow! It is certainly impossible to give a fair account of the meet. It was INSANE! As all of Bill's meets tend to be.
"The judging was top notch with John Zemken as head judge. He was awesome with clear, sharp press calls right in the ear and words of encouragement for all the lifters. Side judges were rotated throughout the day."
Butch Smith & Joe Wargo came in with their families all the way from Jersey just to help out with the meet. These guys certainly have a heart for the sport. Best damn human deadlift jacks in the business.
"Skullptures by Seeker supplied the always awesome scultured reapers, JP Dogs and skulls. Carl also benched a nice 510 before heading for some elbow surgery."
Jeff McVicar took out another amazing world record with a press of 665. What a filthy bastard. He's so fucking hot we had to ice him down after the meet.
Deb Ames did her first full meet in 2 years. She totaled 1055. What an awesome lifter as well as an awesome individual. Great job Big Earl!
Ray Brunk rocked the house with his 1860 total in the full meet. Ray is amazing. He represents the Albany Strength team well.
"Ending the meet at the Full Moon, with Elvis impersonations, table dances, boob flashes, and ofcourse once again Zane had his pants down.....only this time all the men joined him and it looked like one big Calvin Klein ad."
Adirondack Barbell is sure to succeed with many awesome meets to come! Great job Bill and Sebastian. You certainly know how to get it done.


 
Is this the first fucking time we've seen a smile here or what?
Butch Smith & Joe Wargo came in just to help out. How cool is that?
heh heh heh.....just another easy target.
