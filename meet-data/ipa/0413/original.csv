I took several photos and tried to post as many lifters as I
"could. The lifters with pics are underlined, and you can"
just click on the name to see the pics. If I have missed
"you and you'd like to send me a pic of the meet to post, I'd"
be honored to use it.  If I have made an error on your
"page, please let me know. You can email any errors or"
submissions to
