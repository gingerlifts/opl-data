Return to Iron Asylum 

Skullptures by Seeker debuted the Graveyard trophy. These were a huge hit. See more of Carl's work using the link..
The judging was top notch.
An interesting cast of characters at the head table.
"As can be expected, Big Mike and Big Earl were there to support the lifters."
They even found a use for Hal's ass.
"Deb acting all ""catty""."
Zane acting all...well...Zane.
Extremely capable spotters throughout the day.
Janis kept Buster in line...and kept his ass covered. Thank you Janis


Best lifters

Bench - Bill Crawford - 700

Deadlift - Butch Smith - 700
"It certainly should be no surprise that Mike Miller & Deb Ames put together yet another awesome meet. There was certainly a full house at Nazareth Barbell on this day. I was really impressed with the amount of first time lifters. It's great to see the sport grow, and get this...7 chicks...that's a bunch. It was certainly a great day, with big lifts and big laughs. After a long, great day of lifting, we got together for some after-meet laughs. Ofcourse this was all picture worthy as well. Everyone had a little of Buster's ass. There were more Elvis impersonations and ofcourse for some reason, yet again, the men had their pants down (what the hell is up with that...it has become a tradition). Anyhow, a good time was had by all."
