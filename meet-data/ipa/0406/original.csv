"I took several photos and tried to post as many lifters as I could. The lifters with pics are underlined, and you can just click on the name to see the pics. If I have missed you and you'd like to send me a pic of the meet to post, I'd be honored to use it. You can email it to me at meets@ironasylumgym.co"
