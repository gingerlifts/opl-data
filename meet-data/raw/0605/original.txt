World Championship Belt Lightweight – Doug Parrish

World Championship Belt Heavyweight – Nick Minneti


This meet was a big success with tremendous competition and huge numbers for the 1 day meet. Our
Federation made history with Big Nick Minneti hitting a 2100lb TOTAL RAW & DRUG FREE. He was pushed
every step of the way with the 1 and only Beau Moore on his heals. This meet saw many records broken in all
lifts and all weight classes.

We had competitors from Massachusetts to Florida. We tested 20 lifters which is over 20% of the meet. The
World Bench meet had 25 lifters tested and all were clean and we are hoping we had the same results with this
meet. Over the past few years we always seemed to find a few lifters test positive for banned substances but I
think the word has spread that we test and the druggies are staying home.

I wanted to say a big thank you to our Judges and spotters. The Judges were Ed Brooks, William Hawkins,
Donnie Kieffer, Dave Lhota, Mathew Wilson, Keith Payne, James Lopes. And the spotters were Keith Groves,
Andrew Smith, Matt Wilson, Shawn Lyte, Ray Berry, Gene Berry, Ronnie Biggs, Daniel Biggs.

Thank you to our wonderful platform managers Charlie Barley and Jeremy Wright for their 1st class job making
this meet run so smooth.

Thank you to the wonderful table help of Sabrina Lhota, Dianne Perry, Cheri Grant and Shawn Lyte.

I would like to thank Gary Couch for his expertise as an EMT in helping with 2 of our lifters who were injured.
The doctors at the hospital said Gary made a very good split that helped relieve any further injury or pain.

I feel confident that we might have a front cover to powerlifting USA magazine with Nick's 2100lb total. I do not
want to over shadow anyone because there were so many quality lifters at this meet each winner deserved the
title of a true World Champion.

The 2005 100% RAW Worlds was not only about three times the size of the 2004 worlds, but the quality of
lifting has sky rocketed. I am already looking forward to seeing who is tough enough to hold onto their titles for
2006. As always Paul Bossi offered huge awards, best lifter plaques in every category, and world champion
belts to the top two overall lifters. The meet had a multitude of divisions, but in the interest of the all important
question...who is the best of the best, I want to write about the top three overall lifters (regardless of division) in
the weight classes from 148 to SHW.

At 148, teen lifter Drew Priddy hit a 325 squat to take the lead after the squats, but fell behind the pack after
the bench press. Master lifter Nick Abruzzio from Georgia would lift a little more in all three events then Larry
Smith of South Carolina to win his first world title. Larry would finish in second, and Mike Bates would finish in
third. At 165 Lucas Buff of North Carolina would lead after the bench press by a solid sixty five pounds, but
found himself in second as Michael Ticknor of South Carolina hauled a huge 550 dead-lift to win his first World
Title. Michael Wicker would finish in third.

Doug Parrish had a sixty five pound lead after the squats, and continued to extend it as he totaled 1255 to win
the 181 world title for North Carolina, and become the only lifter to win back to back world titles as well as the
World Lightweight Belt and the Best Lifter Submaster Award. Robert Barth was in second, but a forty pound
lead vanished after the dead lifts leaving him in third behind Gary Lindsey who moved up to second. 2005
(165) World champ Jack Moore looked strong as he moved up a weight class and won the best lifter
police/Fire, and could be a serious contender in 06.
In the 198 class Kevin Webber was best in all three lifts to capture the World title, followed by Kurt Carlson who
needed his 485 deadlift to jump Gary Lindsey into second. Gary finished in third by ten pounds.

Woody Leonard won the best lifter master award, but saw a twenty five pond lead evaporate as Chris Whichtl
pulled a six hundred pound dead-lift for the 220 title as well as the best lifter junior award. Gary ended up in
second, and young Kevin Houlroyd would finish third.

At 242 the future has arrived as Nineteen year old Trey Manning totaled 1675 to not only become the only teen
to win a world title, but his total was higher then anyone in the next two weight classes!!! Oh yeah, he also won
the best lifter teen award. Sean Miller from Massachusetts used a 1535 total to easily finish in second over
Lynn Corbin.

Mike Golden the East Carolina Strength Coach lifted well, and kept Danny Wheel in sight until Danny pulled a
700 pound deadlift to win the 275 world title. Mike finished second and Terry Perkins finished in third. Patrick
Green lifted consistently, which lead him to a the 308 world title over Keith Lightner from Pennsylvania. Corey
White held a twenty pound lead over Sonny Mitchell for the third spot, but William Marrow pulled a 530 dead-lift
to come from sixty pounds behind and fifth place to a third place finish by a mere five pounds over Corey and
Sonny who both totaled 1235.

Paul Bossi called me up weeks ago to tell me in the heavy weight class Nick Minneti was finally going to have
a challenge. Nick simply owns this class, but from Florida we had first time RAW lifter, lifting legend Beau
Moore. Beau hit a 685 opener in the squat, but no more. Nick hit 725, 775, and finished with 800. Beau hit
his opener 520 bench, but again no more. Nick would hit three benches to end at 510. Nick had a comfortable
105 pound lead, and a 790 Deadlift closed the book and win a world title for Virginia, and the world heavy
weight belt. Nate Barnes would end in third.

For the women it was Doreen Wofford who total 570 at 123 who was the top lifter. In the team division the
mixed team division was won by Project Lift from Henderson, NC, the Open Team by the Florida Raw Dogs,
and the Mixed Men’s Team by the Pirate Factory.

Thank you to all the fine lifters, spotters, and crew, for another fantastic meet.
