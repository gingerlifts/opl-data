     Currituck high School was host to the 3rd 100% RAW bench worlds, and for the third year it was the biggest meet of the year. Lifters
all over the East Coast were represented from Massachusetts and New York, Down to Florida and Georgia, and of course a Lot of North
Carolina and Virginia lifters. The quality of this meet has always made it a strong draw. Before I go any further I want to thank the
volunteers who made this meet such a success. The hardest job at a meet is spotting, and we were lucky to have Rich Dombroski, DJ Maurie,
Anthony White Tim Stallings, Luke Star, and the young veteran Matt Wilson. The Judges were Greg Stott, Dave Balduf, William Bateman,
Chris Kennedy, Donnly Nelson, and Tom Houlroyd. The set up crew was Coach Bossi’s weightlifting class from Currituck High School. The
announcers were Cherie Grant and Pam Balance. As always the hardware was incredible, with huge trophies, lots of best lifter plaques, and
plaques for everything from coach of the year to volunteer of the year. The best part is for the third strait year championship belts were
awarded to the top lifters...and folks these belts are unbelievable...and worth any trip to compete for. The meet was 100% natural, which
means no bench shirts, and drug testing. I’m not going to preach about the dangers of steroids, my only statement is if you want to use
them, then please don’t enter a drug free meet. The meet started with the biggest class of the day, 148 and under. The class had
seventeen lifters, but despite giving up 16 pound Melvin Perry would find that the third time is a charm as his 275 bench was enough for a
world record, and the 148 belt. With the absence of two time 165 world Champ Corky Bagget, the title was up for grabs, and in the end
first threw fourth was separated by a mere five pounds. Ricky Young is absolutely one of my favorite lifters, and he told me his goal was
305. 305 would have given him his first world title, but 295 left him in fourth on virtue of body weight. Ricky has added thirty pounds in
the last two years, so I think he has a belt or two in his future. Teen sensation Trey Haque benched 295 for third, and was named best
teen lifter for the second strait year. To cap and extremely close class Dana Sqroi,and Jacob Fox would both hit 300, but by a mere .7th of
a pound Jacob would win the 165 belt as well as the best junior lifter award. Only Will “Chill” Lynch could hit 420 at 181, win the best lifter
light award, and consider it and off day. It was Wills third strait world title. Sylvester Freeman hit second in 2003, third in 2003, but
finally in 2004 he broke threw and his 385 bench was enough to win the 198 belt by ten pound over John Hawley. Since Paul Bossi is my
friend, and since he’s brought huge meets to our area I could be viewed as a bit biased, so judge for yourself. Pauls 485 RAW bench press
earned him his third world title, and third strait best lifter heavy award. If your still not convinced Paul will be competing at the USA PL
bench nationals this year in the open division, and next year in the masters division, and if we doesn’t earn the USA and IPF medals this year,
I’d bet we see one next year. Shaun Hopkins would hit 385 to win the belt for the best teen lifter, but the most impressive performance (in
my opinion) was Ben Hopkins who benched 365 in the (14-15) division. At 242 we saw a new champion as Giles Russel hit a 440 to control the
class. In second place was another great Teen lifter as Trey Manning hit a 375 bench. Roger Ernst would hit 350 for third place, but
earned a belt for the biggest bench in the master 2 division. In the heavy weight class we saw Bernie Jones hit 480 to win the heavy weight
belt. Joseph Hillard would bench a 450 bench for a masters world record, as well as winning the belt for the biggest bench in the master 1
division. This was the third strait year that Joseph has finished in the top three overall in the heavy weight division. In 2005 Joseph may
claim the masters as well as the heavy weight belt. In fifth was Herman Canada, who had such a successful year as he earned Bencher of
the year honors. The 165 mens class was close, but the woman’s class was even closer. The top three lifters (by formula) were so close you
had to count decimal places. In the end Kelly Westcott would bench 1.144% of her body weight over Karen Poyner who benched 1.142%, but
Karen Self wasn’t far behind with 1.125%. We saw a lot of teen lifters, woman lifters, but by far what impressed me was the fact that we
had 26 master lifters, and even more impressively we had six lifters that were in the 60+ division. Special recognition needs to be given to
team Gladiators who would win their third strait world title. This meet just keeps getting tougher and tougher, and I hope to see you next
year!!!
