          Currituck High School was host to the 2004 RAW power-lifting worlds, as well as the Currituck Bench press
championships. We saw the return of many familiar faces, and some strong new kids that are quickly making the veterans
look over their shoulders. A multitude of weight classes and divisions were offered, but we like to list the top overall lifters in
each weight class. In the 148 and below class we had two lifters that jumped out of the pack. Brendon Walsh would squat
270, to take a 35 pound lead in the class, but he had to watch as his lead quickly shrink with Matt Gadiazia hitting four 123
(18-19) World records. In the end Brandon would squeak out a five pound win, but Matt would take home best lifter teen
honors. At 165 veteran Jack Moore had his hands full with two extremely talented young lifters. Jacks strength is his squat,
and hitting 350 gave him the leeway he needed as he set four world records on a way to his 995 total and the best lifter master
award. Luther McGourn was solid in all three lifts, and he set three state records (18-19), on his way to second with a 980
total. Joey McGourn didn’t seem a threat for the top total, but then he uncorked a 450 dead-lift to give himself a very
respectable 940 total. Jack is going to have his hands full. In the 181 class Dough Parrish was pumped, and used text book
perfect form on his way to three state records (35-39) and the 181 title. As good as Dough was, twenty year old Ben Hookers
four Junior state records and 1,120 total makes him the man to absolutely fear in this class, and if he was a pound lighter he
would have been in the 165 class...how scary is that? At 198 Dave Daffron was the top lifter. At 242 Dylan Luks was alone in
his class, but he became the first high school student from Currituck to pull 500, and he set two (16-17) state records...and
verily missed 510 for the World record. In the heavy weights Rusty Slate is just the man, and three world records with a 620
dead-lift/ 1535 was tremendous. Typically that would be the biggest total of the day, but just not this particular day. Roscoe
Ware gave a lesson in super human as he squatted 605, benched 475, and pulled 725 for a 1805 total with four world records
and best lifter heavy honors. I don’t know if it’s scarier that Roscoe just played with these weights, or the fact that he doesn’t
have great form...he just man handles the weight up. We had two ladies with Roshonda Ware and Brittany Patrick both
sweeping the World records in their class. Both of these ladies seemed to have strength to spare. In the bench Matt Gadiazia
would hit 185 for top honors over Brandon Walsh’s 175. At 165 Luther McGourn hit 250 for a ten pound win over Jack
Moore. Dough Parrish became the first lifter to be top power-lifter and bencher with a 300. At 198 Dave Daffron hit 155 to
repeat the feat. In 220 Darius Richardson hit 145 for top honors. Donald Owens would hit 375 in the 242 class to earn best
lifter as well as top honors, and surprise Roscoe Ware earned top bench honors in the heavy weight class. In the team division
the Body Shop of Asheboro NC took top honors. The lifters have a solid core of veteran lifters, but more importantly they
have and excellent attitude, and with lifters such as Jack Moore, Ben Hooker, Rusty Slate, and Dough Parrish they have a
bright future full of titles. In the bench division Project Lift from Henderson NC took top honors. I’ve worked with Lewis
Broadie and William Hawkins before, and I know that not only are they tremendous lifters (although they were coaching not
lifting on this day), but they have and astounding set of values. Their young team was perfectly behaved, they lifted superbly,
and their coaches made sure that all of their openers were light. I hope to see this team at the 2005 World Bench meet in
December. The Squat racks didn’t work correct, so the spotters had lots of fun manually moving the weight up and down to
the proper rack heights. The poor Spotters actually believed Paul when he said it’d be over by one, the veterans, we new
better. Thanks to the Spotters of Donnly Nelson, Danny Decastillia, and especially Kinta Mallory who loaded/spotted all day
long. Thanks to Pam Balance for announcing, and gave Luther Gagnon hug her after he broke her sons squat, bench, and
total record that had been on the books for several years. Chris Balance is now a Marine at Camp Lejune, and we all wish
him the best, and look forward to seeing him again.
