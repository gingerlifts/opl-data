        The Wilmington Bench Press classic brought in a great group of quality lifters. A lot of new faces, as
well as veterans like Ed Thayer and Brad Gabbert. 100% RAW is great about offering a multitude of divisions
for the lifters, but Paul and I always like to stack the lifters up by weight class, to see who is the best on any
given day. Some times it’s the open lifters, sometimes the master, and even a teen can steal the spot light.

       In 148 it was neither, as the woman dominated this class. Rebecca Bullard’s 135 opener was enough to
win, but ended with a very impressive 150 at only 126 pound of body weight.

       The most competitive class of the day was 165, where first through third was decided by a mere five
pounds. Scott Wesley needed all three attempts to get 315 to stay in the meet, and earn third place. Michael
Brinkley opened with 315 and ended with 320 on his third, but Michael Mason would go 300, 315, and 320 to
win on body weight.

     Anthony Graham used a 360 to easily secure the class. Marcus Brown finished second. Michelle
Omokaiye benched 170 for the biggest woman’s bench of the day.

       Only two lifters have won four consecutive World Titles, and one of them is Will “Chill” Lynch. He
dominated the 198 class with 440, and believe it or not he’s capable of a lot more. I’m sure we’ll see him try to
make it five in November. Not to be overlooked is another strong lifter, Anthony Bannerman, who hit 410.
Weighing 185 he could go down a class, or stay put depending on Will’s class, and have a good chance at his
own world title. Carleton Pickett used a 405 bench to secure the 220 class over the always popular Ed Thayer.

         Wow. Jauncey “Rock” Lewis nailed 600 pounds at 242 to destroy the competition by nearly 250
pounds. This is one lifter who absolutely needs to be at the Worlds. The battle in this class was for second, as
four lifters were separated by twenty pounds. Master lifter Jimmy Goodnight went 1 for 3 but the 365 was
enough to hold off Pete Serra who hit 355, as well as James Matthews and Ryan strange who both hit 345.

       The Wilmington Bench Classic ended with two veterans dueling for the Heavy Weight title. Donald
Owens and Herman Canada both nailed 450 openers. Herman would take the lead with 365 on his second
attempt, but Donald would answer with 470. Neither could get there third attempts, giving Donald the overall
title.

        This was another fantastic meet by the 100% RAW federation, and a nice precursor to the biggest meet
of the year. The 2006 World Championships. Lift hard, but most importantly keep it fun.
