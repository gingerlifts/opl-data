2007 “100% RAW” WORLD
POWERLIFTING CHAMPIONSHIPS
December 1st & 2nd
West Shore Junior/Senior High School * Melbourne, Florida
 

 The 2007 “100% RAW” World Powerlifting Championships were an overwhelming success!  Over one hundred athletes participated, sixty-eight lifters and four teams captured world titles, one hundred twenty-three world records were shattered, and my very good friend, Brian Kissel (45-49, 308), broke four world records and won his class. He is going in for back surgery on Wednesday, December 5th.  Please keep Brian and his family in your prayers.

The 2007 Worlds were run in four sessions over two days.  The 220s, 242s, 275s, 308s, and SHWs invaded the platform on Saturday morning with a vengeance.  Junior lifter Robert Samsa of Shadyside, Ohio, was flawless, going ten for ten en route to his world title.  Robert shattered the record books in all three lifts and won Best Lifter honors in the Open division, totaling 7.78 times his bodyweight.  Steve went without a belt in the submasters and broke all four Ironman records in his world title win.  Master lifter (40-44) Woody Leonard of Leland, North Carolina, went nine four nine in his world title bid, breaking world records in the squat (555), bench (340), and total (1460).  In the 242s, Nick Hammer (25-29) of Edgewater, Florida destroyed the record books with his 1665 total.  Michael Eaton (30-34) of Hanover, Maryland represented Polak Made Hardcore Gym Equipment and finished with a 1730 total that included an awesome 700 pound deadlift!  Master lifter James Jacobs of Clearwater, Florida, lifting with the Florida RAW Dogs, broke all four records in his class, nailing lifts of 650, 430, and 700 to take the win. Master lifters John Rooney (45-49) of Huntingtown, Maryland and Richard Cerrato (65-69) of Tampa, Florida posted huge numbers in the 275s in their world title wins.  John tallied world record lifts in the squat (590) and bench (420), and Richard ran the table, going 455, 360, and 540.  Odenton, Maryland’s Dan Corridean, also representing Polak Made Hardcore Gym Equipment, joined Brian (Kissel) in the 308s, taking the 30-34 year old age group with his 700 pound deadlift (without a belt!) and 1720 total.  Finally, three athletes competed in the SHWs and each won their respective age group.  Sixteen year-old Anthony DiBiase of Wildcat Powerlifting competed for the first time on a “100% RAW” platform and secured world records in the squat (445), deadlift (475), and total (1190).  Junior phenomenon Cody Yager of Ridge Manor, Florida, another member of the Power in the Blood contest staff and team, went 650, 440, and 700 to shatter the record books and win his class.  And last, but certainly not least, was master lifter and “Jesus Believer” Beau Moore of Indian Shores, Florida.  Lifting with the Florida RAW Dogs, Beau posted the meet’s biggest lifts (725, 540, 700) and total (1965) to retain his world title.

On Saturday afternoon, the ladies took the platform along with several of the lighter men’s classes and kept the adrenaline pumping.  Youth lifters Samantha Montgomery , (77 pound class, 10-11), Katrina Thompson (77 pound class, 12-13) of Wildcat Powerlifting, and Moriah Douglas (88 pound class, 12-13) of Wildcat Powerlifting kept the crowd alive with their world record lifts.  Thirteen year-old Amanda Graham of Wildcat Powerlifting was the meet’s top teenage lifter, posting world record lifts of 150, 72, and 190 to win the 105s and lead the Wildcats to the Overall Mixed Team title.  Daria Dermelev of Estonia nailed a 132 world record pound squat to win the 12-13, 114s, and Samantha Shores of Wildcat Powerlifting posted world record lifts in the squat (137) and deadlift (195) to win the 123s in the 12-13 year old age group.  In the 132 pound class, Brianna Kissel of Wildcat Powerlifting took the teenage honors (14-15) with her world record squat of 150 pounds.  Marci Stein flew down from New York and went ten for ten, shattering the record books and taking Best Lifter honors in the open division with lifts of 205, 135, and 255.  Marci’s coach and training partner Ellen Stein totaled nearly six times her bodyweight to capture both the Champion of Champions award and a world title in the 132s.  Ellen’s lifts of 275, 140, and 335 were impressive to watch, and her 750 total is bound to stay in the records books until she sets foot on the platform again!  Nona Hubbard (45-49) of Raymond, New Hampshire took the 148s with world record lifts of 210, 140, 300, and Simone Wyatt (30-34) of Gulf Shores, Alabama was equally impressive with her world record lifts of 235, 115, and 280 to take the 181s.  Master lifter Kari Sabin (40-44) of Auburdale, Florida closed out the women’s lifting in the 198s, going nine for nine and posting world record lifts (310, 215, 400) across the board.  

Samantha’s (Montgomery) twin brother, Paul, led the men’s charge on Saturday afternoon, nailing a 160 pound deadlift at a bodyweight of 94 pounds to get things started.  Patrick Moran (12-13) of Wildcat Powerlifting took the 114 pound title, and teammate Gustaf Pena (Dominican Republic) secured the 132 pound title in the 14-15 year old age group.  Tony Conyers of the Florida RAW Dogs had a ministry commitment (Praise God again!) that led him to the platform on Saturday.  Competing in the 45-49 year old age group, 165 pound class, Tony nailed a 500 pound squat on his second attempt to shatter the world record.  In his descent on his third attempt, Tony pulled a hamstring and was unable to make the lift.  He came back to the platform, however, and hit a 365 pound world record bench and a 450 pound stiff-legged deadlift to win his class.  Tony also totaled 7.99 times his bodyweight (injured!) to take Best Lifter honors in the masters division.  We wish Tony a quick recovery, and look forward to his healthy return to the platform!  Estonia’s Sergey Dermelev, competing alongside daughter Daria, broke all the records in the 45-49, 181s without a belt!  Sergey hit lifts of 462, 330, and 530 en route to his 1322 total.  Master lifters Steve Smith (70-74) of Oviedo, Florida and Peter Hubbard (65-69, 181s; Nona’s husband) closed out the day’s lifting.  Both Steve and Peter competed in the push/pull category.  Steve hit an impressive 265 world record deadlift in the 132s, and Peter’s 265 bench and 300 deadlift were both good for world records.

Sunday morning saw the 198 pound class on the platform, as well as the members of Paul Bossi’s Currituck High School team.  Currituck’s Jacob “Pablo” Manuel (Mexico) started things off, nailing a 327 pound world record squat in the 18-19, 148s.  Jacob won his class as well as Best Lifter honors in the teenage division totaling 1012 (7.25 times his bodyweight!).  Jacob’s teammate David Jones (18-19) was also impressive on the platform, with lifts of 385, 260, and 450 to take the 165s.  Currituck 181 pounder Tugboat “PJ” Wheeler (16-17) was the platform favorite.  Tugboat won his class in the 181s with personal bests of 330, 235, and 420 in his “100% RAW” debut.  Junior lifters Justin Pannucci and Jameson Fullick of Melbourne Beach Fitness continued to keep the crowd revved up in their “100% RAW” debut.  Justin went 455, 325, 505 and Jameson hit lifts of 415, 345, and 505 to go one and two in the juniors.  Patrick McCauley of Edgewater, Maryland registered the morning’s second largest total at 1275 in the 30-34 year old age group, while master lifter George Walker (60-64) of Sebring, Florida nailed the morning’s biggest bench at 350 pounds en route to his world title.  George has been diagnosed with leukemia but refuses to let it keep him from the platform.  George will be starting another round of chemotherapy next month; please keep him in your prayers!  Finally, seventy-five year old Noble Carr of Palm Bay, Florida was the crowd favorite, setting world records across the board (255, 260, 330) and destroying yours truly in the bench.  I know I speak for all those present on Sunday morning in saying, “Noble, YOU ARE THE MAN!”

Sunday afternoon’s lifting saw competitors from the 123, 132, 148, 165 and 181 pound weight classes close the meet in a grand fashion.  Wildcat lifters Frankie Ramos and Kern Vijayvargiya (India) started things off going one, two in the 16-17, 123s.  Frankie’s thirty second, 130 pound bench got the crowd off their feet and junior lifter Robert Mayer of Coram, New York electrified the platform with world record lifts of 270, 210, and 415.  At a light 128 pounds, Robert totaled 6.99 times his bodyweight to win the 132 class and was awarded the “Coolest Deadlift Technique.  Wildcat lifters Dominick Cioppa (14-15) and Yanni Tshontikidis (16-17) won their age groups in the 148s; Dominick totaled 705 in his second meet and Yanni’s 915 total (6.22 times his bodyweight) gave him the strongest teenage total without a belt.  148 pound master lifter Paul Griffith of Gettysburg, Pennsylvania nailed a 375 pound world record squat before injuring his shoulder; we wish Paul a speedy recovery and look forward to seeing him on the platform at the Masters Nationals in March!  In the 165s, teenage lifter Rocco Rippolone (16-17) of Melbourne Beach Fitness and Al Annunziato (60-64) of Melbourne, Florida lifted strong in their “100% RAW” debuts; Rocco’s 205 bench was the heaviest in his class and Al hit world record lifts of 225, 235, and 355 to capture his first world title.  181 pound master lifter Patraic Currey (60-64) of Palm Harbor, Florida exhibited picture-perfect technique in each of the three lifts, finishing with world records across the board in his world title win.  242 pounder Mike Harrigan of Power in the Blood kept the crowd screaming throughout his 45 second bench at 155 pounds; Mike is paralyzed from the chest down as a result of an automobile accident and has found his niche in drug free powerlifting!  Finally, incredible lifting was performed by submasters Rolando “Rollo” Manso of Altamonte Springs, Florida and Tom Roselli of West Kingston, Rhode Island.  In addition, master lifter John Polak (45-49) from Seven Valleys, Pennsylvania joined Rollo and Tom to keep the crowd off their feet.  Tom totaled 7.19 times his bodyweight to register the second strongest total (1065) in the submasters, while John hit lifts of 450 in the squat, 320 in the bench, and 500 in the deadlift (7.69 times his bodyweight).  Rollo was the weekend’s top lifter, totaling 8.00 times his bodyweight!  His 410 squat was good for a world record, and his 1185 total won the 148s, the Champion of Champions award, and Elite total status.  More importantly, Tom, John, and Rollo supported the teenage athletes that competed on Sunday afternoon, offering both technical advice and encouragement.  Simply stated, their character and demeanor was more impressive than their lifting, and it was an honor to serve them in my capacity as the contest director.  

With the lifting behind us, it is time pay tribute to those that made the 2007 “100% RAW” World Powerlifting Championships the overwhelming success that it was:  

First, many thanks to the brave men and women of the United States Armed Forces for defending our nation and making it possible for drug free athletes to compete on a raw platform in the greatest country on earth!  May God grant you both safety and success in all you do!  

 “I just wanted to thank you for a great experience.  I completely enjoyed the meet and the incredible people that attended … I was very impressed with the entire meet and I look forward to attending another one of your functions in the not too distant future.  Please keep doing what it is you do.  I think you are making a big difference in the powerlifting community.”  With that said, “hats off” to: Georg & JP Baker (concessions), Larry Bucchioni (spotting, loading, judging), Don Daube (spotting, loading, judging), Sam Gough (scoring), Denise Graham (announcing), Brian Kissel (spotting, loading, judging), Jon Landau (spotting, loading, judging), Dave Lhota (spotting, loading, judging), Jan Montgomery (spotting, loading, judging), Mel Perez (spotting, loading, judging), Kelly Quinn (photography), MJ Quinn (photography), Steve Ryder (spotting, loading, judging), Micki Thompson (concessions), Bill Tinkler (scoring), Paul Bossi  (judging), Sava Tshontikidis (concessions), and Cody Yager (lifting HUGE weight).  

Third, thanks and congratulations to the members of Wildcat Powerlifting, their families, and the staff at West Shore Junior/Senior High School.  The kids did an outstanding job helping with weigh-ins, setting up on Friday night, working on the platform Saturday and Sunday, and cleaning up Sunday night.  In addition, seventeen Wildcats secured world titles and broke nineteen world records during the two-day event.  Thanks to Rick Fleming (principal), Jim Melia (facilities administrator), Gary Neff (custodian), and coaches Tony Riopelle and Greg Eller for their support.  Finally, thanks to the Wildcat parents for their support of the team and drug free powerlifting.  

Fourth, thanks go out to “100% RAW” President Paul Bossi for judging, “Doc Junkins” coaching on the bench, and the AWESOME awards (Elizabeth City Trophy); John Polak (Polak Made Hardcore Gym Equipment) for the AWESOME platform equipment; Lee Nessel (Sports Editor) of Florida Today for her AWESOME coverage of RAW powerlifting; Brian Howe for an AWESOME job managing the platform and spotting on Saturday; and Woody Leonard for AWESOME judging on Sunday.  

Fifth, thanks to all those folks who helped out over the weekend and I failed to mention.  Please accept my most sincere apology and grateful thanks!
Before I close, here’s some good news: Brian’s surgery was successful, and he is recovering well.  Tony’s hamstring is still painful, but the swelling is receding and he hopes to get back in the gym next week.  Paul’s shoulder remains injured, however, he told me that it is healing as expected.  World Champion Larry Bucchioni also injured his shoulder during the bench; he reports that he can open a tube of toothpaste without pain, so he’s heading to the WNPF Single-Lift Nationals this month!  Good news deserving of an AMEN!

Thanks, Spero
