       Hosted by 100% RAW President Paul Bossi, the 2006 100% RAW National Bench Press &
Powerlifting Championships was an overwhelming success! Held at the Doubletree Hotel in Orlando,
Florida, the two-day contest saw lifters representing 18 states with an age span of nearly seventy years.
Friday evening’s National Bench Press Championships was highlighted by the grace and power of
North Carolina’s Jennifer Thompson. An IPF World Champion, Jennifer’s 280 pound bench at a
bodyweight of 130.7 secured her both a place in the 100% RAW World Record books and Best Lifter
honors. New Jersey’s Dennis Cieri, competing in the 198 pound class, registered an awesome 525
World Record bench and Best Lifter honors. Master lifter Ken Connelly from Illinois (40-44) rounded
out the Best Lifter trio with his double-bodyweight World Record bench of 360 pounds in the 181
pound class.
In addition, the contest saw numerous National and World Records being broken, to include a 305
pound bench by Florida’s Brian Goetz (132 pound class), Will Lynch’s (North Carolina) 445 pound
bench in the 181s, and Bert Rosenfeld’s (Florida, 181 pound class) 245 pound bench in the 70-74 year
old age division. Will’s “Camp Mayhem” team also captured the Team Championship trophy.
Saturday’s full-power meet proved to be a continuation of Friday’s record-breaking feats as Florida
lifters Kari Sabin (Women’s Master), Omar Bermudez (OPEN, 165), Bill Beekley (45-49, 220), Scott
Weech (20-24, 308), and Beau Moore (40-44, SHW) were joined by Oregon’s Joey King (20-24, 198),
New Jersey’s Victor Parets (40-44, 198), and New York’s Eddie Debus (18-19, 242) to set the pace for
an awesome day of lifting.
Kari shattered the World Record books with her lifts of 335, 220, and 405 for a 960 total. Omar,
coming off a four-year layoff, lifted flawlessly, registering a 1400 pound total in the 165 pound class.
Omar’s efforts were rewarded with a first place finish, Best Lightweight Lifter honors, and the Overall
Best Lifter award. Joey, an Oregon firefighter, pushed up huge numbers, to include a 635 pound
World Record deadlift. Victor’s 1435 total secured him a first place finish in the 198s and Best Lifter
honors in the heavyweight division. Bill, who serves as the 100% RAW Florida State Chairman, won
Best Master Lifter with his lifts if 510, 320, and 600 in the 220s. Eddie, a teenage lifting phenomenon,
registered an impressive 1605 pound total, humbly crediting his Lord and Savior after each lift. Scott
and Beau rounded out the day’s lifting, firing up the crowd and registering the meet’s biggest totals
with 2040 and 2050 efforts, respectively.
Congratulations to all the lifters on their efforts and accomplishments. The numbers prove that
equipment and drugs are not necessary for big totals!
