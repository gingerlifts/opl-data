	The 2008 World bench meet was held in Virginia.  Although there are a lot of big meets, the RAW worlds is usually the biggest.  In 2008, dead-lifting and curling were added to the meet.  In typical Bossi style, the awards were huge, plentiful, and there was a lot of best lifter plaques.  The best part, as anyone who has come to a world meet knows, is the World championship belts.  They look awesome, and it’s hard to earn one.  

	Typically one saves the best for last, but in 2008 I think the best came in the first  class.  Adam Zeher of New York benched 320 to win the Lightweight world belt, then returned to hit 330, but what makes Adam amazing is he only weights a 121 pounds!!!  It was enough to earn him the best lifter light award, and he wasn’t finished.  Adam benched his weight for 60 reps (no-one else went over 42) to win the light weight for reps division.  

	Finishing in second was Judstin Tripodi, also from New York, who benched 309.  Justin curled 121 pounds, which was enough to earn him the world belt for the best open curl.  Rounding out this strong class was Joseph Powell who curled 94 to win the best teen award.  

	Corky Baggett won the 165 world title in 2002 and 2003, in 2008 he returned to bench 325 and win his third belt in three tries.  No-one has more titles at 165.  Corky also captured the best master 2 lifter award.  Also in this weight class was Rob Hanners of Virginia who dead-lifted 562 to win the world belt for best open dead-lift.

	If you asked me the most memorable thing about the 2007 worlds, it’s simple,  Will Lynch lost.  This simply does not happen.  In 2008 “Chill” came back stronger.  His 452 bench earned Will a record sixth world title, as well as the best lifter sub-master award.  Will is the present, but the future could be nineteen year old Andre Decastro of Virginia.  Andre finished third overall, but his 364  earned him the world belt for best teen lifter.  

	Missouri took the 198 title, courtesy of Chase Stratton’s 424 pound bench.  Chase also earned the best lifter junior award.  Mario Cole was a close second with 413.  Mario benched his weight for 42 reps which earned him the best lifter (reps) heavy award.  Finishing in fourth was Curtis Page, but he actually earned the world belt.  To earn the belt you “Must” have your entry in on time, and he was the only one who did.  Rounding out this class was Kos Jackson who won the world belt for best special Olympian

	At 220, Keith Herron of Indiana benched 457 for his first world title.  Aaron Johnson came in second with 440, but don’t feel bad for him.  Aaron was light enough to win the best lifter heavy award, and the best lifter police and fire award.  2007 runner up Joe Rascoe finished in third.  

	We had a lot of great lifters from New England, but at 242 Lane Grush benched 457 to capture the states only world belt of 2008.  The battle for second was close as both Shane Petterson of Nebraska, and Carl Mueller of New Hampshire benched 402.  Carl took second as the lighter lifter, and he earned the best master Curler award.  
	
    	In 2007 Donald Owens tied for the world title, but finished in second as the heavier lifter.  Donald came back stronger in 2008, benching 468 to earn him his first World title, and the second of the day for North Carolina.  

	At 308 North Carolina won it’s second strait class, when Denvel “Cheeseburger” Sutton benched 361 to become the only teen lifter to win a world title.  To qualify for the open belt you must be in the open class, which allowed Horwitz to capture the world belt at 308.

  Denvel then pulled up 606 to earn the best teen dead-lift award.

	In the heavyweight class, Thomas Dillard benched 468 to earn Virginia another world title.  He followed his bench with an even more impressive 710 dead-lift which won him the world belt for the best master dead-lift, as well as the best dead-lifter award.

	The men’s classes were all loaded with talent, but every year the best match up seems to come down to the woman.   To keep it interesting and competitive, it’s done by formula.  Every year it seems to come down to a fraction of a point, and it seems that it’s Kelly Wescott of North Carolina who comes up a little short.  Kelly was the runner up in 2004, third in 2006, and again runner up in 2007.  In 2008 she was once again locked up in an impossibly close match. Tammy Walker, also of North Carolina, hit 209 on her second attempt, but missed her third.  Kelly Wescott hit 154, 165, but returned to make her third attempt of 171.  I t was the difference as she won 63.63 to 63.23.  Congratulations to Kelly who has truly earned her belt.
  
	Winning the team title was Team Powell of Fort Bragg North Carolina.  I hope the belt winners return in 2009 to defend their titles, and I hope anyone who thinks their strong enough to take a belt makes the trip to do so.  

	P.S. Anyone who hasn’t been on the RAW website needs to check it out.  Not only does it have all the state, national, and world records, but it has rankings, interviews, and lots of information to help lifters.  Check it out at rawpowerlifting.com.
