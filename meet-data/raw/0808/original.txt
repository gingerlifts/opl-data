Meet Director: D.J. Satterfield   Sponsor Director: Richard “Vince” Vincent. 
The 100% RAW Powerlifting Federation 2008 Nebraska State Championships were held at the A.V. Sorensen Recreation Center in Omaha, NE. 100% RAW is growing at an amazing rate in Nebraska. We had 39 lifters from 4 states (NE, IA, MO & SD), ages 13-63, with 28 competing in the full meet.  The meet was completed in just over 5 hours, thanks to some great help.  
We also raised over $200 for Camp CoHoLo, a local camp for children ages 6-17 with cancer or a blood disorder, through admissions and t-shirt sales
I would like to send a huge thank you to Bill Purcell, Pramote Khamsanit, Kris McNeil, Mac Capello, Jesse Jobe, Tim Horton , you all were incredible all day loading and spotting. Also, to Howard Huffman, Tonya Satterfield, Cindy Gunia, Jake Gunia, Paul Bossi & Elizabeth City Awards and Keith Machulda. I want to thank my beautiful wife and Bob Coco for doing a great job on the microphone again, organizing the cards and keeping the lifting moving along.  Without all of you, this meet would have never run as smoothly as it did.
