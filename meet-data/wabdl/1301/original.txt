                                                          unabated gaining momentum daily. So why a cover story on
                                                          the successor to Big Iron Gym? Powerlifting will always be a
                                                 diverse sport and while Big Iron Compound is one of the best multi
                                                 ply gyms around, even they have a contingent of raw and single ply
                                                 lifters, some moving to multi ply. This sport is constantly changing
                                                 and it’s exciting to watch!

                                                 Jim Grandick, owner of Big Iron Compound, writes an article called
                                                 The Evolution of Gear and justifies why he and his team like multi ply
                                                 gear. Even if you lift raw, you’ll find it very interesting and persua-
                                                 sive.

                                                 As a powerlifter you should compete at least once or twice a year to
                                                 really see if your training is paying off. Which federation should you
                                                 lift in? Last issue Gus Rethwisch told about why he started WAB-
                                                 DL and where he sees it going. In this issue, Steve Denison, head
                                                 of USPA explains why he started a new federation, what it’s doing
                                                 and where he thinks USPA and powerlifting in general are headed.
                                                 This will hopefully be a regular feature to help you decide among the
                                                 choices that you have as a lifter.

                                                 Are you in your 40’s or older? Thinking about getting your kids
                                                 involved in powerlifting? You need to read both of Ron Garofalo’s
                                                 articles.

                                                 Our deadlift training article started as an interview with Dr. Tom
                                                 Eiseman, who pulled 800 in 1986, RAW, at 165! He’s 55 now but still
                                                 one of the best deadlifters in the world and has a routine that makes
                                                 a lot of sense. A friend of mine, Russ Clark, has been using his own
                                                 instinctive variation of this routine for years and just pulled an all-
                                                 time raw PR three weeks ago at age 53. I think Dr. Eiseman is on to
                                                 something!

                                                 There are some strong powerlifting chiropractors out there. This issue
                                                 has two of them contributing: Dr. Eiseman’s deadlift article and Dr.
                                                 Mark “Powerdoc” Van Alstyne telling us what he has learned in 24
                                                 years of powerlifting.

                                                 Other features include a powerlifting book review, raw squat tech-
                                                 nique, some meet results and articles that should be of interest to
                                                 everyone whether raw or geared, new to the sport or veteran. We’re all

                                                 There are a few meet results in this issue because I thought I’d follow
                                                 the template of “the magazine that went out of business 2 ½ years
                                                 ago”. There are almost 50 (!) powerlifting federations according to

specifically powerlifters, not meet results. I used to think that if a meet
I entered was “in print”, that made it legitimate and I could show my
kids someday the “proof” of what I had done. If you want that, it’s easy
enough to go to your federation’s website, go to meet results, print that
and frame it, or go to www.powerliftingwatch.com. You’ve had to do
that anyway for the past 2 years, especially since there hasn’t been a
magazine printing meet results for that time. If you’re an “old guy” with
no computer access one of the younger guys you train with will probably
be glad to do it for you. If every fed sent in their version of the “Greater
Eastern Podunk Memorial Lift Big Extravaganza” with 30 lifters, we’d
have to publish a separate magazine! We have made an editorial decision
that content over data is what lifters want to read, so since National and
World meets are always interesting as they draw a lot of top lifters from
across the country, we will print those along with the accompanying story
from the meet director. All meet results, whether on a federation’s web-
site or Powerlifting Watch are contingent on the meet director getting the
results posted along with a write up and pictures of the event to us.

My goal is to produce the best magazine possible and encourage my
fellow lifters with articles and interviews that are inspiring and practical.
All the gems in this issue NEED to get in the hands of lifters everywhere
and word of mouth is still the best way. Each subscription helps us to do
our job better and believe me, it ain’t cheap to make a magazine! Take it              POWERLIFTER TODAY
to your gym and show it around! Send us a “review” and we will put it                  September/October 2014
on our website and on Facebook. It all helps and you are doing the sport
of Powerlifting a good deed (not to mention your fellow lifters). Thank                Editor/Publisher Jim Curley

    HOW YOUNG
    IS TOO
    YOUNG?
    By Ron Garofalo
           Some old myths die hard. One of them is that
           training with weights will “stunt growth”
    in teenagers. Some coaches, parents and medical
    professionals still believe that one shouldn’t do
    resistance training until fully grown. I would like to
    address that and youth powerlifting in general.

     A Challenge For the Title
     the World’s Strongest
     Chiropractor
     Iinfirst became aware of Tom Eiseman when I went to my first WABDL World meet
        in 2008 in Las Vegas. The big showdown was Tom against Tony Caprari, both
         181’s. Tom opened with 800 and missed, Caprari went to 749, and Tom almost
     got 800 again, both times just short of lockout. Caprari won that day, but it was
     an amazing shootout to watch. Since then I don’t think he’s been in any deadlift
     competition where he’s pulled less than 700 even on a bad day. He routinely lifts at
     181, single ply.

     So how old are you and what do you do?

     I’m 55 and I’ve been a chiropractor for 19 years. I pretty much do straight
     chiropractic but end up teaching most of my patients to deadlift. They’ll have a
     stronger back by bending at the waist, which is a deadlift.

     Are you married? Any kids?

     Yep, been married since 1991 and we’ve got two boys, 14 and 17. They’re not
     much interested in deadlifting, but they’re good students and they take karate.

     How long have you been lifting and how did you start?

     In high school the coach was a powerlifter and a good bench presser. He showed us
     the powerlifts and I don’t remember how I ended up doing this, but at 130 pounds

                                              Have you competed yet?

                                              Yes, I’ve done two meets, both raw and both UPA. My best lifts so far
                                              are a 330 squat, 170ish bench, and 315 deadlift. Haven’t gone gear yet,

                                              How old are you, and how long have you been powerlifting?

                                              I’m 29 and started powerlifting in 2008. I started at the original Big
                                              Iron.

                                              What weight class and gear do you usually compete in?

                                              I usually lift in 181, but I’ve done 165 and 198 also. I like multi ply just
                                              because most Big Iron lifters use it.

                                              What are your best meet lifts in the last year?

                                              At an SPF meet at 181, I squatted 640, benched 413, and deadlifted 455.

                                              Are you married, and what do you do for a living?

                                              I’m single, and I’m the Activities Director at a retirement home. I love
                                              my job, and I know that that is where God wants me to serve. Between
                                              the gym and work, that’s my life for the most part. This is my family
   KRYSTAL CAREY                              and the main reason is loyalty and support, and that we all like each

                                                  I’m 61, and I’ve been with the team 6 or 7 years.

                                                  while I lift. He would never want to do this. My daughter powerlifted for about
                                                  5 years at 165 (I’m 132), and she could never beat my deadlift.

                                                  Do you like single ply or multi ply better?

                                                  I like them both, but what I really like is this group and most of them do multi
      RITA CARLSSON                               ply, so that’s what I do most.(Rita missed 400, Grandick added 10 pounds for
                                                  410 and she got it. Good coaching!).




                                                  You’re a big dude. What do you weigh, and what’s your powerlifting
                                                  history?

                                                  I’m 27, weigh around 300, and I started powerlifting in 2011. My best raw
                                                  meet was 700 squat, 400 bench and 700 dead. Best single ply was 1000 squat,
                                                  600 bench, and 715 deadlift.

                                                  You mentioned at breakfast that you played rugby in college. Do you
                                                  think that helped your conditioning for powerlifting?

                                                  Yeah, I weighed 330 and running up and down the field for an hour and a
                                                  half most games had to help. I don’t do it anymore but I can still feel some
                                                  carryover.

                                                  Are you married, and what do you do for a living?

                                                  I’ve been married about four years, and we have a 3 ½ year old daughter. I’m a
      DUSTIN SLEPICKA                             dispatcher for Union Pacific railroad, which I really like but I’m on third shift.
                                                  Saturday squat training is tough because I work 10pm-7 am Friday night, get
                                                  off work, come here, squat heavy, try to get 4 or 5 hours of sleep, and go back
                                                  to work.

                                                  What are you looking for today?

                                                  1025, maybe up to 1070, so we’ll see. (He got 1025).




24   POWERLIFTER TODAY - SEPTEMBER/OCTOBER 2014
                COVER STORY




                You’re the father of Luke and Zack, and you also train here. How
                old are you, and what do you do?

                I’m 56, and I’m a sheet metal worker.

                How long have you been training at Big Iron, and what are your
                best recent lifts?

                About six years. Zack and I used to train at home, and I couldn’t spot
                him anymore. We found Big Iron and that’s when I started training and
                powerlifting. I squatted 450, 325 bench and 500 deadlift. I’m competing
                in the upcoming Dubuque meet and hoping for a 600 squat, PR bench,
                and 425 deadlift raw.

                Jim said if anything needs fixed around there, you’re the man!

                Even when Rick was alive I’ve always liked tinkering and fixing things.
                I’ve built my own bench and squat racks, and I’m always coming up
DENNIS HENSON   with ideas. I mostly like helping in the sport. I judge, spot and load at
                four meets a year. I’d really like to see this sport grow starting at the high
                school level.




                How old are you, and how long have you been with the team?

                I graduated high school last year, just turned 19, and I’ve been training
                here about 3 months.

                Got any meets coming up?

                I’m training for an AAU single ply meet in Lincoln July 19th.

                What are your best recent lifts?

                I was in a push pull meet last March. I went raw and benched 290 and
                pulled 573. I’d like to total 1500 this next meet, but we’ll see. I’ve only
                been in the gear about two weeks.

                Most of your team lifts multi ply. Any plans to lift that way?

                Maybe. I’d like to eventually do it, but it’s a whole different animal than
LUKE HENSON     single ply. (Luke got a 550 deep squat in single ply).

                                                  COVER STORY




                                                  How old are you and how long have you been powerlifting?

                                                  I’m 24, and been powerlifting four years. I was just looking to train when I
                                                  walked in the original Big Iron, but started powerlifting right away because
                                                  everyone else was.

                                                  What weight class are you usually in, and what are your best recent meet
                                                  lifts?

                                                  275 or 308. I lift multi ply and my last meet 1 1/2 years ago I squatted 854,
                                                  benched 600, and pulled 690. That was a UPA meet.

                                                  What do you do for a living? Are you married?

                                                  Heck no I’m not married! Living the good life. I do contract security for
                                                  Google. (Mike got 775).


      MIKE NEUENDORF




                                                  How old are you, and how long have you been powerlifting?

                                                  I’m 22 but I started training at 17 at Big Iron to get stronger for high school
                                                  football. Rick Hussey saw I was stronger than my buddies, so he kind of
                                                  pulled me into the main group.

                                                  Didn’t you just have a big injury?

                                                  Yeah, I had a quad tendon repair about 3 weeks ago. At my last meet, I opened
                                                  with 903 and was coming up when my knee turned in, and that was it. The
                                                  meet before that was USPA and I squatted 903, benched 600, and pulled 705.

                                                  Are you married?

                                                  I’m getting ready to propose and she has competed in meets, so there shouldn’t
                                                  be any conflict as to training!

                                                  What did Hussey say to you the first time he saw you squatting?

                                                  Well, I had horrible form, but worked up to 500 the first day I was there. He
                                                  said, “You can’t squat-Mexicans don’t squat. You guys just bench!” It was
                                                  funny because he didn’t have a prejudiced bone in his body. He took everyone
      LUPE CARRAZCO                               in and treated everyone the same, from the weakest to the strongest. He gave
                                                  every lifter a hard time, and always reminded us that somewhere, someone
                                                  was working harder and getting stronger.

                                                  Will you squat soon?

                                                  I won’t be able to squat for 6 months, but I should enter a push pull pretty
                                                  soon. I’m planning on a full meet in January 2015.




26   POWERLIFTER TODAY - SEPTEMBER/OCTOBER 2014
                   COVER STORY




                   How old are you, and are you married?

                   I’m 52, divorced twice and my current girlfriend and I are back for the
                   third time. She’s got twin boys who are both 22.

                   What do you do for a living?

                   I retired from the Air Force in 2001 and went back to school. I’m now
                   a project coordinator for Alegent Creighton Clinic setting up clinics for
                   electronic health records. I’ve been there for 6 ½ years.

                   How long have you been with Big Iron?

                   I joined in 2000 and have been there in one form or another since.

                   How did you get into powerlifting?

                   I was stationed in Turkey, and there were guys training on the base. Four
MIKE TAYLOR        or five were doing the powerlifts, so when I got stationed in Kansas in
                   1990 I entered a NASA meet. I went 220, and squatted 480, benched
                   340, and pulled 500.

                   What did you think of the monolift and multi ply gear?

                   Monolifts and multi ply gear weren’t even around then. Hussey had jack
                   stand power racks like every other gym and we all lifted single ply or
                   raw because that’s all there was. The first Frantz canvas suit came out
                   in the mid 2000’s, and we all started using them because lifts started
                   going way up. We all learned together.

                   What class do you compete in, and what are your best recent lifts?

                   Mostly 242. I entered a bench only meet in May and got a 665. My
                   last full meet was in 2012 due to minor injuries, but Saturday when
                   you were here, I got a 775 double with straps down. On the following
                   Wednesday, on deadlift day, I pulled 650 for a double. It was sumo with
                   straps up.

                   How long do you think you’ll keep doing this?

                   I’ll keep going until the body says no or I get tired of it. I’ll never quit
                   lifting but I may stop competing someday and just train and coach. I’ve
                   got a full meet in November, so I’m hoping to hit at least what I did two
                   years ago, which was 900-620-670.




                   How long have you been powerlifting?

                   About six months. My dad was a childhood friend of Rick Hussey so
                   I’ve always known about the gym. My boyfriend is Zack Henson who
                   also trains here. He trained at the original Big Iron, got invited here, and
                   I came with him and I loved the sport.

                   How old are you, and have you competed yet?

                   I’m 20 and went in my first meet in May where I competed in single ply
                   as a junior, 114. I entered an SPF meet, got a 210 squat, 125 bench, and
                   got a 250 deadlift. (Maggie hit 275 today.)

                                                  How long have you been lifting here and what’s your age?

                                                  I’m 27 and just started lifting here about five weeks ago. I got adopted by these
                                                  guys and I’ve been powerlifting about four years.

                                                  What’s your weight class and best recent meet lifts?

                                                  275, multi ply in a USPA meet last October I squatted 903, benched 606, and
                                                  I’m not proud of my deadlift, but I pulled 617.

                                                  What do you do for a living? Married?

                                                  Got a girlfriend, soon to be married. I run a community center in Neola, IA up
                                                  the road. I wrestled in college and I have a wrestling club where I train kids.
                                                  My girlfriend is a personal trainer, so she gets the fitness thing to a degree,
                                                  but she’s glad Big Iron supports my powerlifting. Wrestling adapted well to
                                                  powerlifting because in wrestling it’s just you in a singlet, so they’re kind of
                                                  similar. My first raw meet was four years ago at 220 and I got a 460 squat. I’m
                                                  looking for over 1000 at the next meet under these guys’ tutelage. (Jake got a
      JAKE HEAD                                   1025 today).




                                                  How old are you, and how long have you been with BIG and BIC?

                                                  I’m 38, and been with the gym since 2004. I took the last five years off
                                                  to spend a lot of time with my son from age 10 to 15, and now he’s more
                                                  independent, so I’m back.

                                                  What was your best meet 5 years ago, and what weight class were you?

                                                  242. I squatted 1003, benched 650, and pulled 694. At the upcoming July UPA
                                                  meet I’m looking for a 1025 squat, 705-715 bench, and 760 pull at 275.

                                                  Tina said you have a tanning business.

                                                  Well, I’m a realtor in Omaha/Council bluffs, we do personal training, and our
                                                  spray tan business, Simply Gorgeous keeps us very busy. Real estate is really
                                                  booming in Omaha after some lean years but we’re survivors.

                                                  What else should we know about you?

                                                  I lift multi ply, and they call me “Stanky”, ‘cause I smell so bad. I smell good
                                                  for clients, but I bring a “special” smell for the team! I am so blessed to be a
                                                  part of this team and to have known Rick Hussey. I take my hat off to Jimmy
                                                  Grandick for taking the step to start this gym and getting much of the old team
                                                  together, along with some really good new people to the sport. I feel I still
      JUSTIN REDDING                              have some big numbers to do so I’m back for good. As a team we get together
                                                  a lot – barbecues, birthdays. Rick Hussey was a giver – he’d just give give
                                                  give with no thought of reward. He gave us his time and we all are thankful for
                                                  what he did for all of us. He taught all of us to be mentally tough, and we’re
                                                  all so grateful to Jimmy and Mary for carrying it on. One of the reasons Big
                                                  Iron always squatted on Saturdays, and still does, is you can’t go out partying
                                                  Friday night if you’re going to hit big numbers on Saturday. That was Hussey’s
                                                  plan, to keep us away from the bad stuff, because he had had such a hard life
                                                  coming up in East Omaha. It takes a special person to care like that and he was
                                                  a once- in- a- lifetime person. (Justin got over a 1000 today).




28   POWERLIFTER TODAY - SEPTEMBER/OCTOBER 2014
                                                      COVER STORY




How long have you been a powerlifter?

I can’t believe it, but it’s been almost 35 years. I’m 46 and entered my first meet
at age 11.

That’s awfully young. How did that happen?

I started wrestling early and wanted to get stronger for the sport. I started lifting
weights at age 9 and my uncle kind of took me under his wing and got me into
powerlifting. My bench press took off from there.

Was this all in Omaha where you live now?

No, I was born and raised and got married in Redding, CA and moved to
Harlan, IA, then to Omaha. My boys are now old enough to lift and compete
with me.                                                                                DANNY THURMAN
What are your best lifts in a meet in the last year?

My best single ply bench in the last year was 625 at 181. In a multi ply meet at 198, I hit a 665 bench, 700 squat, and a 500
deadlift. The single ply meet was USPF, and the multi ply was SPF. I may lift in a USAPL meet sometime soon; in fact, I was
just randomly tested out of meet by that federation 8 weeks ago. I set a USAPL Masters 1B bench press record of 583 at 198
in a 3 lift meet.

I’ll ask if you want to answer - What is your opinion on performance enhancing drugs?

I personally choose not to take them, but I don’t feel it’s my place to judge others if they do. If I want a level playing field I
just compete in USAPL. I would like to see a rigidly drug tested multi ply federation, but oh well.

How long have you been lifting at Big Iron?

I met Rick Hussey probably 20 years ago. I lived 70 miles away so I’d train maybe once a month at his gym. He always
welcomed me in, and I’ve been training with the team for the past 6 or 7 years. Everyone comes from different walks of life
and many lift in different feds, but as a team we all help each other out.

What do you do for a living?

My wife is a clinical psychologist and I’m her office manager. She has two offices, and I also run a fitness facility. I’ve been
married 20 years and we have three sons,15, 20, and 24, so we stay busy! During the off season of my sons’ sporting events
we train together and they often compete in powerlifting. I’m constantly at baseball games.

What’s your next scheduled meet?

Most of the team, myself included, is entering a UPA meet in Dubuque, IA on July 19th. I’ll be 198, and looking for a 725
squat, at least a 700 bench, and 525 deadlift.

Will you be multi ply in the deadlift?

No, I’ll likely go single ply. I haven’t deadlifted in multi ply, and there’s a whole learning curve to it. People think you just
slap on more layers and lift more weight, but it’s a different groove, along with getting stronger in that groove. Multi ply is
much different than single ply and to use either you have to be strong raw, but a lot of strong raw guys would have to re-learn
the gear to be effective. Your leverages change with each one. I’m really thankful for Big Iron and the chance to train with
such a variety of top lifters. The camaraderie and family element as a team, the mutual love of the sport – it’s the best. (Danny
got a 700 squat today).

                                                  I’m 21 and I’ve been lifting since I was a freshman in high school. I
                                                  played football, but in my senior year of high school I started training at
                                                  Big Iron and was so taken with it I quit football to train powerlifting. I
                                                  enjoyed lifting weights more than hitting people.

                                                  What are your best lifts in a meet recently?

                                                  I had a meet in March and I did a 780 squat, 455 bench, and a 645
                                                  deadlift, weighing 190. I had done a single ply meet 3 or 4 years ago, but
                                                  liked multi ply better. I was the first 181, age 16-17, to squat 700 in the
                                                  country, regardless of federation. When I started powerlifting, I was in
                                                  a USAPL meet, single ply, and got a mid- 500 squat, benched 300 plus,
                                                  and pulled a mid- 500 deadlift. Today in training I got a 785 squat, and
                                                  925 on the green reverse bands.

                                                  When’s your next meet?

                                                  The IPA meet in Dubuque on July 19th. Most of the team is competing
      ZACH HENSON                                 and the ones who aren’t are coming to cheer and help out. It should be a
                                                  lot of fun. I’m lucky that my girlfriend Maggie trains and competes too!
                                                  Our lives are simple – work, train, and sleep.

                                                  What do you do for a living?

                                                  I install interlocks on cars, the Breathalyzer that causes the car to not
                                                  start if you’re drunk. I worked in a salvage yard before that pulling
                                                  engines and transmissions and my back would be toast at the end of the
                                                  shift, so this is a great job for powerlifting. This is a subject change, but
                                                  do you know about the stars that Rick Hussey had tattooed on his hands?
                                                  If one of his guys held an open record, then won nationals and worlds,
                                                  Rick would tattoo a star on his hands. He had twelve when he died, and
                                                  Dustin and I think we can get the records. If we do, we’re each going to
                                                  get a star tattoo.

                                                  Man, Hussey’s been in the ground for almost 4 years and he still
                                                  influences the team.

                                                  He left such a legacy. I still get pumped before a big lift remembering
                                                  something he’d say.

                                                  Most of the Big Iron team lifts in multi ply, monolift federations.

                                                  Yeah, those federations attract top level elite lifters. I’m drug free, but
                                                  I still like going against the best to see who lifts the most weight that
                                                  day, period. I’ve squatted 835 (not today!), and at the meet July 19th,
                                                  I’m going for an open world record. That will be the world record in
                                                  that federation. I hate these guys who scour all the different federations
                                                  current records to see if they could get it, go to the meet, and declare
                                                  themselves a world champion. Lift in the federation that you like and
                                                  try to be the best in that fed. People say if you’re drug free, lift in drug
                                                  free feds, but I don’t think the records are what they should be, and I like
                                                  multi ply gear, meets, and records.




30   POWERLIFTER TODAY - SEPTEMBER/OCTOBER 2014
                                   COVER STORY




                                   I’m Justin Redding’s wife and have been training here about 3 months. I’m
                                   getting ready for my first meet in July, which will be my husband’s comeback
                                   meet, so it’s cool that we’ll be competing together!

                                   How long have you been married?

                                   Three years, known each other for 16 years.

                                   What’s your age?

                                   35. I’ve been lifting weights since 1997.

                                   What are you hoping for at the meet?

                                   350 squat, 150 bench, and 320-340 deadlift. It’s a UPA meet and I’m going
                                   raw. If I go over 350 in the squat it will be a UPA National Record, but I just
                                   want to have a good meet and have fun.

TINA REDDING                       Think you’ll go geared down the road?

                                   I’ve been trained in my form to use gear, so I’ll make the transition to single
                                   ply, then multi ply.

                                   Do you have kids?

                                   Justin has a 15 year old son, and we might try after the meet! We have a
                                   business where we’re gone 2 weekends a month, going to big bodybuilding
                                   shows and doing spray tans, hair, make up, so we’re really busy. The women’s
                                   figure, bikini, and bodybuilding shows have just exploded and they cap us
                                   as far as how many shows we can go to, otherwise we’d never get to them
                                   all. There are a lot of women competitors in these shows who want to try
                                   powerlifting, so we try to encourage them to try it. They want to do both to
                                   build more muscle.




          Jim and Mary, thank you for letting me stay here and train with
          “the family”. This was a unique experience, and I wonder if there
          is a gym or team like this anywhere else in the country. Everyone
          that trains here loves the camaraderie, but each member constantly
          strives to break personal and federation records, and they usually
          do that at every meet they enter. If you live in the Omaha area, go
          to Jim Grandick’s Big Iron Compound Facebook page and get in
          touch with him. PLT

         All About Powerlifting
         by Tim Henriques

         Reviewed by - Jim curley




         T
                   his may be the most comprehensive and thorough
                   book on powerlifting yet! Aptly named “All
                   About Powerlifting” is 486 pages and 19 chapters
         crammed with useful information on every aspect of our
         sport. Every author has a base set of presuppositions and
         it’s useful to know where someone is coming from. Tim
         is a lifetime drug free lifter who has been competing for
         20 years, mostly in USAPL meets. He holds Virginia state
         records and national records in USAPL, including a 700
         pound deadlift at 198.

         The book starts with What Is Powerlifting? I doubt if
         anyone could do a better job with this and with the surge
         in powerlifting and new lifters, this will be a valuable
         chapter. What is often overlooked is when someone begins
         powerlifting and then has to explain this “new sport” to
         their spouse and family members. They could hand this
         book to their skeptical family and say “Here, read this”,
         and it would make the lifter’s “new obsession” much more
         understandable. He then goes into the history of powerlifting
         before getting into the three lifts. Woven into the discussion
         and how-to of the squat, bench press and deadlift are
         interviews with 5 top lifters (3 male, 2 female), and these
         are all very interesting.
                                                                          certainly lays it out well. I definitely agree with the “XYZ
         While veteran lifters can always get a tip or reminder from      Federation Champion” title for the year as opposed to
         everything they read, I would say the first 260 pages or so      “World Champion”. Being 59 years old and knowing that
         are more directed toward the beginning to intermediate lifter    Tim is 37, I disagree with him on the subject of gear vs.
         who probably trains alone. You can watch YouTube videos          raw but I appreciate his position and thoughtfulness on that
         all day long but nothing beats a well-illustrated book to have   subject. It will make you think! Even his interviewees all
         open in the gym on training day.                                 agree that unification in the sport will likely never happen.

My “powerlifter cardio” currently is 3 or 4 HIIT cycles on the
treadmill (one minute max effort, two minutes slow walking,
repeat), then 3 sets of 8-12 reps on GHR with minimal rest.
Yes, that’s a piano bench cushion. I can do all this within 20

           T         his magazine covered Big Iron Compound in
                     this issue, but since most of the lifters at BIC
                     use multi ply gear, I offered to write an article
           about it. Many raw and single ply lifters have a prejudice
           against it, without really knowing anything about it. My
           opinion follows.

           I was a bodybuilder in the 1990’s when I discovered Big
           Iron Gym in 1997. I liked Rick Hussey and powerlifting
           right away and started training there. The only gear
           available at that time was single ply squat suits and
           bench shirts and they had arrived on the scene in the
           early 80’s. Since the goal of most powerlifters is to
           minimize injury while gaining strength, gear made
           perfect sense to all of us. There were no raw meets or
           federations at the time and everyone was lifting more
           geared than raw. I went to an APF meet around 2001
           and at 242, single ply, got 683-501-688. A couple of
           guys there had canvas Frantz suits and were squatting
           in the low 800’s so I got one when I got back. A few
           weeks later I smoked a 770 first time I wore it and I was        why raw is so popular. You can do it on your own. Multi ply
           sold! Multi ply briefs started showing up so I got some          gear is expensive, and you need a team. We always kept
           predator briefs and a year later I was squatting 850.            moving up in tougher gear because we wanted to lift more
                                                                            weight. That’s the bottom line, lift more weight.
           I went from a poly bench shirt to a denim shirt where I
           got 625. I tried one of the first double ply Rage-X shirts       I’ve squatted 1000 lbs more times than I can count and it’s
           and I smoked 650. This was around 2004 and in a multi            a rush every time I do it. I entered the Arnold two years ago
           ply SDP, I’m currently close to 850 at 45 years of age. I        which is single ply and got 727-606-710. I’m thinking about
           usually deadlift in a single ply fusion with briefs which        another USPA meet soon in single ply because before the
           I’ve had since 2006.                                             meet two years ago I got the flu a week before the meet. I

           I’ve heard single ply and raw lifters say it’s cheating, but
           there’s a definite science and technique to it. You don’t        “WE ALWAYS KEPT MOVING UP
           just jump in the gear and get huge lifts. Training for it        IN TOUGHER GEAR BECAUSE WE

occurring. Single ply will always be around because that’s
the logical next step for raw guys who can just feel that
injury coming around the corner. We’ve got one of the
biggest raw lifters, Kent Fleming, who knows he’s near his
limit with 1000 raw last year. He’s transitioning to single
ply but is already talking MP because he wants to lift as
much as he can.

Multi ply has probably reached its limit as far as number of
layers. I haven’t really seen much change in ten years and
the lifts in MP haven’t really gone up either. It’s probably at
a stalemate.

Going back to the evolution of gear, you don’t see NFL
players in leather helmets or wood shafts on golf clubs.
That gear evolved mostly for safety and performance. The
squat is the squat, not squat and walk out. That’s how the
monolift evolved. In the 80’s, Fred Hatfield was getting
ready to squat 1000 and asked the spotters to lean the
racks forward after he removed the weight so he didn’t
have to walk back. There was no rule about it, just the
squat.

     kinds of other events going on like strongman, bodybuilding, MMA,               do is compete and offer a great lifting experience. I want to thank all of

     get exposed to all these different events and a lot of them say, “Hey, that
     powerlifting looks interesting. I want to try that”. It’s great exposure
     of powerlifting to non-powerlifters. That’s how a lot of women find
     powerlifting. Women’s powerlifting in CA is just exploding because of
     these expos.

     Are most women lifters in the raw divisions?

     They’re mostly raw, but as they enter meets they look at single ply lifters
     and think about moving up to that. It’s mostly curiosity about how much
     more they could lift in gear. They ask me how they get to the Olympia
     and when I explain that it’s single ply with high qualifying totals and
     that they need to learn gear to get there, they’re excited about it and start
     training in gear.

     Maybe we’re entering a golden age of powerlifting, kind of like when I
     started in 1980.

     Powerlifting was on TV in the late 70’s and it should be again. I think
     raw has a lot to do with it, but powerlifting is just getting a whole new
     rhythm to it. I can’t keep up so I’m looking for an assistant! I just never
     thought powerlifting would take off like it has.

 LIFTING FOR LIFE - PART 2

    n our last issue I raised the idea that not only could masters-aged lifters who
    have been competing for decades still progress in strength performance, but also
    actually achieve new personal records in meets at an age well past what most
would expect. I gave several recent examples of such lifting just in the Denver area

     PROTEIN                              I               once in your life you have taken whey protein. Whether it’s from
                                                          the cooler at the gym, the local supplement shop or from the
                                                          grocery store, you have at least tried whey in one form or another.
                                                          It’s even possible that you found yourself saying, “I don’t need
                                          to buy protein at a supplement store when I can get it for half the price at the

                                          are many things to look for
                                          when examining the back of
                                          the label. You should look
                                          for the type of whey protein
                                          they are using as their pro-

                                          you a little on what you

                                          processing used to refine the isolate also removes most of the lactose, cholesterol,
                                          fat and carbohydrates. Isolate is the highest quality and most expensive form of
                                          whey protein.
                                          Whey Protein Concentrate – Concentrates are the most common form of whey
                                          protein. It tends to be the cheapest to produce and not a bad option when you’re
                                          on a budget and if your stomach can handle it in large amounts. Concentrates
                                          have a significantly higher amount of lactose than isolates, which can make it
                                          difficult for people to digest who are sensitive to dairy. Concentrates are usually
                                          80% protein or less. That means with a decrease in percentage of protein in every
                                          scoop comes an increased amount of carbohydrates, fats and cholesterol.
                                          Whey Hydrolysates – Hydrolysates are proteins (either isolate or concentrate)
                                          that are already broken down, either by acids, heat or enzymes. In theory this
                                          would lead to an increased digestion speed. However, both isolate and concen-
                                          trate already digest quickly and with the tendency to cost more than traditional
                                          concentrates and isolates, it might not be worth the added expense.

                                          There is something else that some of these “whey proteins” are listing on the la-
                                          bels and it is what I consider to be one of the biggest problems in the protein mar-
                                          ket today and this is why I think a good chunk of the proteins in the mass market
                                          today are garbage. This practice is commonly referred to as “amino spiking” or
