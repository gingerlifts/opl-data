2003 IPF North American Cup Championships
The 2003 IPF North American Cup took place on Saturday; March 01, 2003 in King of Prussia, Pennsylvania (Suburbs of Philadelphia), and was a triumphant success. Two teams from the United States and one team from Canada were present.

Team USA selections for this particular international event were selected based upon on their best Wilks formula score from a USAPL National Championship, or an IPF International Championship that took place during the past twelve (12) months. This contest utilized the European Powerlifting Federation (EPF) Cup format, with the placing of each team being determined by the average of the top five lifters cumulative Wilks scores.

Contest highlights:
Caleb Williams at just 18 years old broke Wade Hooper's long-standing IPF Junior World record in the squat with 293kg/646lbs. Caleb's world record squat was completed on a fourth attempt, and was very extremely explosive, easy, and most of all deep. Believe it or not folks, he had more left in him. In writing this article, I am still amazed at the potential this young man has. I have seen many of the great lifters in the history of Powerlifting perform, from around the world, and this young man has all the making of becoming a superstar. Ray Benemerito lifted with great precision and control to take the overall Champion of Champions. Look for Ray to make significant gains, by nationals to finally break the 2000lb mark in this weight class. Tony Succarotte had a terrific day, with a personal record total of 877.5kg/1934lb total, and even took a fourth attempt shot at Joe Mcauliffe's IPF world record in the bench press. The lift stalled right at the top. Look for Tony to break this record at this year's national championships in South Dakota. Rimi Fortier of Canada broke a long-standing Canadian national bench press mark with an impressive lift of 202.5kg/446lbs. Kroczeleski, O'Donnell, Hafenbrack, Barbier, Whigham and Kahanek are young lifters, with much promise for the future. National contenders Davis, DiCataldo, and Mastrean were a little off, but will be ready by nationals. The final team standings between USA Team #2 and Team Canada for second place was extremely close. USA Team#1 won convincingly with huge Wilks scores turned in by Succarotte, Benemerito, and Williams. The coaching staff of Team Canada did a superb job, with their lifters missing 9 of a total 54 attempts - Outstanding coaching! Look for this contest next year in either sunny Florida or Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. I have many more ideas as to how we can expand the scope and potential for international Powerlifting in the North American Hemisphere.

Finally, I would like to send special thanks to the following people for making the contest so successful: Larry Maile, USAPL Vice-president, Robert Wagner - Coaching Committee Chairman, and to the coaching committee as well, Bill Clayton - Technical Secretary; Referees: Al Siegel, Jack Marcus, Larry Maile Announcers: Robert Wagner Scoring Table: Theresa Kunsman, Eric Finkelstein, Brenda Siegel, Mike D'Amore, and Dave Follansbee; Admission: Mike Siderio; Computer Scoring: Don Wilson; Medical Officer: Bernie Miller; Spotters/Loaders: Tony Braca, Ed Cridge, Jesse McCabe, Dan Ratchford Sponsors: Inzer Advance Designs, and American Bodybuilding Nutrition Also, special thanks to Jeff Butt, President of the Canadian Powerlifting Union (CPU), and to Louis Lï¿½vesque, President of the Provincial Quebec Powerlifting Federation (QPF) for supporting this particular event. Last and most important, I would like to take this opportunity to thank Inzer Advance Designs and American Bodybuilding Nutrition supplements for their sponsorship of the contest.

Sincere congratulations to all the athletes - Great job!
