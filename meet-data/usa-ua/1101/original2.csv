"Submitted by a. campbell on Sun, 10/23/2011 - 07:49 ANdy did th eBullfamr 2 weeks ago. When he got home he got a virus and for 5 days ate nor drank nothing and lost from 350 all the way down to 308 and almost had to go to th ehospital. He tried to eat and drink his way back, but as you can see, he was still 25 pounds lighter. He just rested for the entire week and hoped his strength would return, but it did not. He is a true champion and refused to back out of his challenge and made the huge trip over to face America's biggest pullers. He was very gracious and just admitted ""I got me 'arse' kicked"".",,,,,,,,

,,,,,,,,
"Submitted by a. campbell on Sun, 10/23/2011 - 07:52 Vince opened with teh biggest American deadlift at 308 ever by defeating Kennady's 20+ year old record. He smashed it! Then he passed his second and went for 938, the biggest American deadlift ever regardless of weight. However, he used the hook grip and tore s huge hunk of meat off his thumb and this huge blood clot formed at the tip. On his last lift coagulated blood started squeezing out like tooth paste and just shut the whole thing down. Amazing strength and he hopes to return to the NOTLD schedule permitting to became the greatest American deadlifter ever.",,,,,,,,

"Submitted by a. campbell on Sun, 10/23/2011 - 07:54 Tom Eiseman had what he thinks was gout in his hand for the month prior to the meet. He was unable to even hold the bar for 3 weeks and on his last week had to switch his grip just to pick it up. He refused to back out of the challenge. He opened very light just to get in the game, and barely missed his second. Like Bolton, he refused to back out and miss the competition and yet did the best he could on that day.",,,,,,,,

Too bad Andy and Tom weren't able to be at their best. They showed a lot of heart by showing up anyway. Kudos to all the competitors. Can't wait to see the videos.",,,,,,,,

"Submitted by a. campbell on Sun, 10/23/2011 - 08:15 Richard Hawthorne is amazing. There is no one on the planet that can touch him on bodyweight. He did 4.8x his bodyweight. His precision and set up are impeccable. He wins the first ever NOTLD deadlift belt. He said he woulc be back to defend that belt next year and if anyone thinks they can beat him, all you have to do is show up and take it from him. Good luck with that!",,,,,,,,

If he lost 2 pounds and put 4 lbs on his deadlift that would be 5 x bodyweight. I think only Gant and Baskharan have done that in PL history.",,,,,,,,

I also love how Vince easily pulled 906, an ALL TIME 308 American record, but didn't ""beat"" a guy who pulled 611 and lost a bunch of prize money over it. So retarded. Maybe a guy weighing 95 lbs will deadlift 420 and ""beat"" Andy Bolton next year. It totally makes it easier for tiny guys to ""beat"" larger men. A guy weighing 300 lbs would have had to deadlift like 1,400 to beat Hawthorne on coefficient. Way to go Vince, you are the man!!!!!!!!!!!",,,,,,,,

Since this contest has 2 winners, one for biggest pull and one for best coefficient then I dont see a problem with it. This was a great show and I have to say the 2 highlights from the platform for me was Vince pulling 906, and Alison's deadlift with only 1 leg, its just an amazing feat. Off the platform it was a great show, all the competitors were really nice and I made a few new friends. For anyone that is interested, we are having Alison on RX Power Hour this week to tell her story and how she has overcome to make history.",,,,,,,,

All of the lifters were,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,
"Submitted by a. campbell on Sun, 10/23/2011 - 08:22 All of the lifters were great, but a bery special moment was Alison McWeeny. Many of you kow her story but this mazing 21 year old came all the way from Washington state and lifted balanced on one leg after a terrible accident. She lost her balance on her third and the crowd demanded she get a fourth when they blew the roof off the joint with a standing ovation. My wife actually started crying when she came back and lifted it on her fourth. Watch for her story on CBS as the play by play guy works for the local CBS affiliate and said he would distribute her story to all of the national affiliates when they got the footage and put it together. We want her on the late night talk shows to inspire people with her story. I will not be happy until she is standing on that ESPY sate as most inspiring athlete. We had soul surfer, but now we have something even better...SOUL DEADLIFTER! Just to talk to her and feel her spirit and her heart is amazing. She has no quit in her and always has a smile no matter what. She should be the hero for our children instead of many of our wife abusing, drug dealing, dog killing, overpaid, pampered, profanity spouting, child-like professional athletes held up to us by the media.",,,,,,,,

Well the NOTLD is over and,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,
"Submitted by McCoy148 on Sun, 10/23/2011 - 23:08 Well the NOTLD is over and what a great experience. I opened with 473.? Went out and got it very easily. Called for 534.5 on my second attempt. This would match a pr. Started my pull and only got it to my knees. I refused to give up until I had absolutely nothing left and had to set it down. With great disappointment I went behind the curtain and tried to clear my head. Tightened my belt one more hole. Widened my stance just a little bit more and grabbed the bar on my third for one more shot at it. With the roar of the crowd I started the lift. This time I was able to get it over my knees. As they continued to cheer I sat back and gave every last thing I had. When the head judge dropped his hand I set the weight on the floor. The Crowd erupted even louder. On the board was 2 out of 3 white lights. A good lift. If I never get to do this again it will go down as one of the highlights of my life. The lineup of lifters was incredible. Getting to talk to Alison McWeeny was inspiring. The members of Exalt Gym reminded me of what we have at the Iron Chamber Gym. A Brotherhood (not just another gym). I came into this meet almost dead last. The goal was to not finish there. I finished 16th out of 20. Alex Campbell and the people of Elizabethton Tn. are a class act. Making my mom and I feel as important as the true greats on the NOTLD roster. Thank You.",,,,,,,,

Its funny that you say that,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,
"Submitted by McCoy148 on Mon, 10/24/2011 - 12:10 Its funny that you say that Dan. Let me tell you what kind of a champion and a class act Vince is. After the meet was over I personally heard him say that he didnt agree with the coefficient. He felt it should simple be a true lb for lb. If that was the case then Richard would have won by an even bigger margin. Due to the fact that the swartz formula favors the bigger lifter. I am a smaller and older lifter and all of my lifts were given the same respect by the Big Guys as every other lifters. These guys were all class acts. Congrats to everyone.",,,,,,,,

I knew there would be a shitstorm after I posted the opinion me and countless other heavyweight powerlifters have. Truth is hard to accept sometimes. The formulas are very skewed to give mugh lighter powerlifters a huge advantage over big guys. That's what I'm saying and it is the truth. Wilkerson did his 1,000 squat but lost to coefficient to some tiny guy who squatted 4 something for ""best squat"". I have had very similar things happen to me and it is a load of crap I do know they had separate awards for biggest pull vs best coefficient thankfully, so whatever.",,,,,,,,

"Submitted by Tom Eiseman on Mon, 10/24/2011 - 15:42 I won 5x with the formula and Andy Bolton beat me pulling 965 using the formula. The formula is designed for olympic lifting and is skewed somewhat, but we are working on a formula that will be more accurate a comparison for each powerlift and the total. Meanwhile, it is the best we have to level the playing field.",,,,,,,,

The schools fire wall kick us out after 15 minutes of being on air. We still filmed the whole show and will be aired on xptvnation in a couple of days. You will be amazed at the Production. You have to see the show to belive it. I have alreday seen it. Richard Hawthorne won the NOTLD Ultimate Deadlifter Belt. Great Job Richard.",,,,,,,,
