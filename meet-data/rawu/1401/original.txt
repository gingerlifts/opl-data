Gene Richards is one of the most impressive lifters I have ever met. A devoted Catholic living in
the Boston area, Gene is a 76 year-old, 165 pounder. One would think Gene would be retired and
relaxing in Florida. Instead he is the “super” of a 30-unit apartment building in one of the
toughest cities in new England – Lynn, Massachusetts. Lynn has a reputation of being the city of
sin. It overlooks Boston Harbor and shares the port with the largest city in Massachusetts. Gene
still shovels snow, moves refrigerators, and trains at Gym Warriors in Peabody, Massachusetts.
Don’t let him fool you - Gene loves to make jokes constantly, puling you in to lead you to another
joke. I sat down with Gene three months prior to his next powerlifting competition.

Author:        So Gene, how many years have you been lifting weights and how many different
               gyms have you been to?

Gene:          Only three.

Author:        (Shocked) Only three; why?

Gene:          YMCA, Worlds Gym, and Gym Warriors. At Worlds Gym I had a gym record of 1400
               pound leg press at 148 and I did the hack squat at 1000 pounds for 1 single rep.
               My favorite of all the gyms is Gym Warriors because of the owner and the people
               who go there.

Author:        How many people would you say you have helped train at some point in time? And
               please tell me some of the memorable ones.

Gene:          Thousands – one kid had a heart murmur. I told him start doing breathing squats,
               bench press and pullovers with dumbells. You take three deep breaths before
               each rep; (I am really looking at him trying to figure out this exercise) so for 1-10
               reps he performed three deep breaths before each rep. After that you try and work
               it up to five deep.

Author:        Every time I talk to you I learn something new!

Gene:          Three waitresses - I made each lose 20 pounds in three months just from taking
               kelp. First month you use it three times a day, second month you use it two times
               a day, and third month is use it one time a day. And a quick way to find out how
               your thyroid is functioning is to take a thermometer and put it under your armpit.
               If your temperature is higher than 98 degrees it’s high, lower than 98 degrees it’s
               slow.

Author:        Again you astound me. Tell me more about some of the people you have trained,
               and what your personal goals are?

Gene:          My wife, Marion, and I started training 43 years ago. She was benching about 150
               pounds at a bodyweight of 110 pounds when she was 40. Marion is 82 years old,
               but suffered a heart attack a few years ago so she doesn’t lift any more.

Author:        What are you looking for in powerlifting?
Gene:          To be the world’s best at my age in powerlifting. I compete raw, no equipment.
               And I don’t want to use any equipment. My current numbers are 275 in the squat,
               225 in the bench, and 360 in the deadlift. At 74, I got I got a 260 squat, 260 bench
               press, and 360 deadlift which was the American record.

Author:        And how about the curl?

Gene:          I can curl approximately 100 pounds, but we do the curl for fun. It’s a bodybuilding
               exercise. I use both partial movement and full range of motion. In the squat,
               training the top of the lift is almost useless because you really are not doing much.
               But in the curl you can use partial movements to gain strength.

Author:        What do you want to get out of this?

Gene:          I want to be a role model for other senior citizens, to inspire them to participate in
               strength competitions. You see them doing all this cardio. What are they going to
               do, run marathons? It’s time to do some weights, and not everyone needs to do
               heavy weights. You can do a variety of exercises as long as you’re exercising.

Author:        I know you do some weird stuff in lifting. Most people need a warm up, but I have
               seen you compete. You don’t warm up at all, you literally go right into the lift. Can
               you explain that to me.

Gene:          At my age if I warm up with a couple sets I will lose 30-40% of my strength. So I
               don’t warm up; this way I can just walk up to my opener and get it. If I warm up I
               will not have anything left for my third attempt. They can see me on Facebook,
               “Old Man Gene Richards Fan Page.”

Author:        What supplement do you use and what supplements do you suggest for others?

Gene:          I use pdg supplements test booster, creatine, and joint food. I also use a multi-
               vitamin and try proteins powders. I suggest isopure and whey cool. For seniors, I
               suggest B complex for stress, a multi-vitamin, joint food, and creatine. These are
               things that can help you in everyday life.

Author:        How can lifters contact you if they have any questions?

Gene:          They can send me a letter to or email pauldesimone01@aol.com with questions or

In the December issue of STRONG LIFE we asked for prayer for Patricia O’Brien and her family.
Patricia’s husband, Pat, a World Champion lifter, passed away on July 26. On April 26 we will be
hosting the 2014 Master’s Championships in Pat’s honor, and are pleased to announce that
Patricia will be joining us on the competitive platform!

                                       PRAYER REQUESTS:




Please pray for R.A.W. United lifter Eric Ostling’s dad who is in the hospital with mobility issues;
his legs are not functioning properly and doctors are trying to figure out what is going on.

Please pray for Sarah Crane’s family and the Elkhart, Indiana community. Sarah went to be with
our Lord after a valiant battle with Stage 4 Colon Cancer. Learn more about this courageous
young woman at www.sarahstrong.org.

Please pray for Lucy Gallo. Lucy is a second grader at the West Melbourne School for Science;
Lucy lost her dad, Air Force veteran Scott Gallo, and she’s struggling.

Please pray for Ruth McRae. Ruth is Tony Conyers’ mom; Ruth has been hospitalized, and Tony
greatly appreciates your thoughts and prayers.

Please pray for Jason Wright. Jason is a Maryland State Trooper that is recovering from knee
surgery.

Please pray for the brave men and women serving on the front lines defending the freedoms we
cherish as Americans.
Please send your Prayer Requests to STRONG LIFE at

PUT ON THE FULL ARMOR OF GOD!

“Finally, my brothers, be strong in the Lord and the power of
His might. Put on the whole armor of God that you may be
able to stand against the wiles of the devil. For we do not
wrestle against flesh and blood, but against principalities,
against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this
age, against spiritual hosts of wickedness in the heavenly
places. Therefore take up the whole armor of God, that you
may be able to withstand in the evil day, and having done all,
to stand.”

                     Ephesians 6:10-13
