                 STRONG LIFE Tampa Bay
The 2020 Florida State Meet was low in numbers due to the Corona
virus, but the energy level was pumping throughout the day as the
Records Books were shattered in every division!

Before we get started, however, many thanks to Bill Beekley and Tony
Conyers for hosting the event and keeping powerlifting alive in the state
of Florida! And, most important, thanks to Bill and Tony for keeping our
Lord and Savior Jesus Christ in charge of it all!

From my end at the score table, it was great to see everyone again and
meet so many great folks! Thanks so much to all of you for supporting
Natalie both on and off the platform, and Natalie and I are STOKED to
be back in our great sport and look forward to hosting all of you at future
events in our brand new gym at Viera Charter School – more to come!

Many more thanks to Bill, Tony, James Jacobs, Burl Morgan, Everton
Frances, Tiffany Mitchell, and Caleb Vance for officiating, spotting, and
loading throughout the day – without these folks, meets just don’t
happen!

And more thanks to Suzanne LaForge and Tony Conyers for presenting
Bill Beekley with his most-deserved Appreciation awards – Bill is
without a doubt one of the sport’s greatest ambassadors!

And finally, thanks and praise to the Maker and Creator of all things, our
source of TRUE STRENGTH - Jesus Christ!

And now to the lifting …

recently revived “Girls Gone Strong” team now headquartered at Viera
