2010 Tony Conyers Extravaganza
Saturday, October 2
Jackson Springs Recreation Center * Tampa, Florida

 “I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me.”
Philippians 4:13

The fourth annual Tony Conyers Extravaganza, held at the Jackson Springs Recreation Center in Tampa, Florida, introduced single and multi-ply lifters to R.A.W. United.  Nonetheless, our host dropped from the 165s to the 148s and shattered the all-time raw deadlift record, pulling an incredible 606 pounds!

Special thanks to Bill Beekley for securing the venue and setting up the main platform area; Tom O’Donnell, Kyle Mishler, and Yanni Tshontikidis for spotting/loading; Jenn Rotsinger, Beau Moore, Tim Burns, Tom O’Donnell, and Bill Beekley for officiating; Dave Bates for live-streaming the meet of Powerlifting Watch; Sir Charles Venturella for the awesome eagle sculptures and Best Lifter cups; Glenn Nichols of JNG Enterprises and Tony Conyers for the contest shirts; and everyone previously mentioned for helping clean up the venue!

Most important, thanks to our military heroes and our Lord Jesus Christ for making our great sport possible in the greatest country on earth!

To the lifting!

National Team member Taylar Stallings led the women’s charge, totaling an impressive 1120 total in the 165s to capture Best Lifter honors!  Taylar was shredded after dropping down from the 181s, and she nailed lifts of 375, 240, and 505 with plenty left in the tank.  Taylar is quickly becoming a dominant force in women’s Powerlifting, and we are honored that she will once again be representing R.A.W. United at the 2011 RAW Unity Meet!  Teenage record holders Monique Dudley and Leilani Figueredo continue to improve; Monique donned single-ply gear and totaled 615 in the 148s, while Leilani went raw and hit lifts of 150, 95, and 250 in the 165s.  Ten year-old Anellys Suarez joined her brother Jorge on the platform, and set records across the boards with lifts of 80, 50, and 135 in the 105s.

Tony’s son Ty (8-9, 66 pound class) competed in his first meet looking like a seasoned veteran on the platform.  Ty shattered the record books, going 90, 40, and 130 en route to his 260 pound total.  On the other end of the age spectrum, Bill Remley pushed an incredible 240 pound bench in the 181s and 80 years young!  Bill has compiled an impressive career in our sport, and his ascension into the 80-84 year-old age group is likely to result in many long standing records!  Matthew Truman and Devin Murray had an outstanding battle in the 220s, with Matt edging out the win; we hope to these tow return to the platform next month at the North Americans for a rematch!  Master lifter Charlie Nelson (55-59) returned to the platform after a ten year hiatus and pulled a 485 pound deadlift with plenty more in the tank.  Charlie is quite the crowd pleaser with his limitless energy and positive attitude, and we all hope he decides to compete at the North Americans!  Jon Elder took Best Lifter honors on the men’s side, posting the meet’s largest total at 1700 pounds.  Jon competed in the multi-ply division so he could bench on his toes, but actually lifted raw.  Jon will be lifting at the North Americans and representing the federation at the RAW Unity Meet.
