                               2017 Tony Conyers Extravaganza
                                          Results



       Below are the results for the 2017 Tony Conyers Extravaganza. It was an impressive and
exciting day of lifting at Stronglife Tampa Bay. Many records were smashed and will be
updated on the site in a few days as long as Irma leaves this area alone. The women of Raw
United continue to grow in numbers and strength. The lifting was highlighted by an over double
bodyweight deadlift by Gigi LaCagnina and a massive 890 total by the great Suzanne LaForge.
There were several newcomers to the platform with great performances as well. The girls of
Stronglife Tampa Bay continue to progress under the watchful eye of their Coach James
Jacobs.
     The men were not to be overshadowed on this day and lit up the platform with some huge
lifts and close battles. Peter Pires took the 181 title along with the pound for pound best lifter
award for the men joining Suzanne LaForge on the women’s side. The 198’s were loaded with
Pro wrestler Derrck Steele taking first place . Kevin Cavinder of Mount Dora captured the
220’s pulling a huge 675 deadlift while nursing an injury. Julian Alessi turned in another solid
performance in the 242’s as did newcomer Scott Morgan in the 308+ class. James Jacobs had
the big squat of the day with his 600 pound opener but then had to withdraw with a hamstring
injury. The 275’s ended in a tie between Austin Burdick and Shane Tumminello with Shane
taking the title on bodyweight.
    We want to thank all the lifters and spectators for coming out and supporting this event. We
hope to see all of you at future competitions. We also would like to thank the platform crew
and officials. They did an amazing job as there were no misloads and the bar did not touch the
floor until we wanted it to. Donnie Kiernan was masterful as the master of ceremonies on the
mike. Thanks to all once more and God bless.
