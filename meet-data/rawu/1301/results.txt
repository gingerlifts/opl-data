                                     THE MAN: BILL BEEKLEY

                Few men in our sport dedicate so much of themselves to its growth.
             Bill Beekley’s selfless sacrifice at the Jackson Springs Recreation Center
                 has literally transformed the lives of young and old over the years.
                                            Thanks brother!


FINAL THOUGHTS FROM COACH BILL BEEKLEY:
Just this past spring, God chose me to be the avenue for some truly amazing ladies to be
introduced to our great sport. I will be eternally grateful for this opportunity to work with this very
special group. These ladies will not let age, medical conditions, or grueling schedules deter them
from constantly making efforts to improve. As I fight the aging process myself, as well as little
nagging injuries and the feeling we all know too well: “I don’t know if I can do this today,” I merely
need to pause and reflect upon what I have witnessed in the weight room at Jackson Springs.
Then I have no excuses not to GET AFTER IT !!! The other thing I marvel at, which is so typical of
the type of people that are drawn to this sport, is their genuine concern and love for each other.
Their ages and weights are just numbers, impressive though they are. Sarah Hand at age 75 is
deadlifting 112 pounds; Trudy Daxon at age 82 pulled 150 pounds; and Carmen Gutwirth at age 70
continues to amaze me with a tireless work ethic and amazing dedication. Then there is
SUPERWOMAN, Edith Traina !!! Edith is 91 years old and runs the huge 200 plus member senior
programs for the Town and Country Senior Stars. She is creeping up on a 70 pound bench press,
will be deadlifting close 115 or 120 pounds, and is making great progress in her goal to compete
in a three lift meet. Words cannot describe this lady! You must see it to believe it. I have been
blessed to have been able to train with powerlifting immortals Tony Conyers and Beau Moore, and
until I met these ladies I had not seen a mental approach to the sport and life in general that could
rival these two legends - these young ladies have it !!!
