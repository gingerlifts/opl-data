With the Youth & Teenage Championships and the Master’s Championships both being held in
April, it seemed appropriate to mark the inaugural events with a double issue of STRONG LIFE
magazine! Part 1 featured R.A.W. United’s youth and teenage contingent while Part 2 focuses on
senior lifters.

On the cover of Part 1 is fourteen year old Megan Lee of Girls Gone Strong. Megan weighed in at
just 84 pounds, yet at the end of the day had buried a 135 pound squat, benched 72 pounds, and
pulled an incredible 200 pound deadlift to capture Best Lifter honors and win the 97 pound class.
Full contest coverage, as well as an update on the 4, 3, 2 training cycle and a feature on
scholarship recipients Kris Hefner and Genna Owen are featured in Part 1.




      Thomas Roman lifted strong in his R.A.W. United debut at the 2014 Youth & Teenage
                                       Championships

On the cover of Part 2 is the timeless Tony Conyers who, at age 57, totaled 1600 at just 160
pounds bodyweight at R.A.W. United’s Masters’ Championships. Articles include Bob Gaynor’s
sixth installment on the History of Powerlifting, Lock-Out Training by bench specialist Adrian
Larsen, and an interview with “Wonder Woman” Kimberly Clark.

Thank you very much for the emails, phone calls, and letters in support of STRONG LIFE
Magazine! We have added several businesses to our advertising pages, and hope that federation
leaders and contest directors will join us in our effort to promote raw powerlifting!

God Bless, and enjoy the reading! Spero

In his final meet before joining the Lord’s Gym, Pat inspired us all at the 2013 Beau Moore Classic

Before we get to the lifting, here is an excerpt from the August 2013 issue of STRONG LIFE written
                               by STRONG LIFE Secretary, Bill Beekley:

Our sport lost a lifting legend and a great man on Friday July 26, 2013, when Pat O’Brien went to
train with our Lord!

Pat’s lifting accomplishments are far too numerous to list in this letter but there are two that stick
out in my mind. One would be an 800 pound deadlift at a bodyweight of 220 pounds. This was in
the 1980’s before deadlift suits or bars. The other would be a 365 pound deadlift at a bodyweight
of 165 pounds at the 2013 Beau Moore Classic. A normal 65 year old would be proud of this
accomplishment but Pat was down to 165 bodyweight because he had been unable to eat solid
food for nearly a year. Radiation treatments on his tumor had destroyed his salivary glands which
left him unable to eat solid food for nearly a year; but Pat kept on training and competing. Still
challenging his cancer, radiation, and chemo-ridden body, Pat was the embodiment of incredible
will and drive!
                             Pat (right) with Ed Gillie back in the 1980s

This ferocious competitor had a flip side that was equally amazing as his lifting career. Anyone
who was fortunate enough to know Pat off of the platform would immediately recognize that he
was a genuine, kind, caring, and principled individual. After attending college and maturing into
an outstanding collegiate wrestler, Pat spent 38 years as a middle school physical education
teacher. And though he will be remembered as a compassionate educator, his greatest asset was
his ability and passion in teaching our sport – an endeavor he continued until his final days. He
was responsible for getting the legendary Beau Moore to begin his lifting career in the early
1990’s, and was a big help to me in coaching youth and the now famous deadlifting grannies! His
kindness and compassion were his most useful tools in this arena.

Not only our sport, but the world, is a little bit of a lesser place without Pat O’Brien. Our Lord has
him now, and he is at peace and without pain. For that, I am happy.

John Wooden once said "nothing is stronger than kindness!” That IS Pat O'Brien. John Wooden
also said "it is amazing what can be accomplished when no one cares who gets the credit for it!”
Pat embodied these traits. Rest peacefully, my friend!

                       STRONG LIFE Training Facility * Melbourne, Florida

The 2014 Master’s Championships brought many familiar faces and some new friends to the
STRONG LIFE Training Facility in Melbourne, Florida. The contest served as a fitting tribute to our
brother Pat O’Brien, with his wife Patti and many of his lifting partners from Tampa among the
contestants.




            Laura Edwards rocked the platform at the 2014 Master’s Championships!

Laura Edwards, making her R.A.W. United debut, led the women’s charge with huge numbers,
going 250 (260 on a 4th attempt), 170, 315 to post the biggest total on the women’s side. Liz
Johnson and Patti O’Brien also lifted extremely well in their first meet with us, and the senior
ladies from the Bill Beekley Academy of Powerlifting inspired everyone in attendance!

Florida RAW Dogs: Jon Wisenbaker, Rick Hoover, Tony Conyers, Tim Burns, and Bill Beekley
On the men’s side, Tony Conyers shocked the powerlifting world totaling 1600 at a bodyweight of
160 pounds! Tony buried a 555 pound squat, benched an impressive 400 pounds, and pulled 645
pounds to set the All-Time record in the 55-59 year old age group. Tony’s teammate, Jon
Wisenbaker, had a strong day, going 440, 310, 165 to win the 181s and Lance Betts registered a
1200 pound total in his first meet since injuring his shoulder.

What does it mean to fail at the lock out portion of the bench press for a raw lifter?

It can mean a few different things. Most commonly, it would be the lack of speed off your chest. It
could also be the transition portion of the lift; half-way through the lift where your technique
breaks down.

So how do we fix this?




          Jack Stevens powers through the lock out at the 2014 Master’s Championships

First, we start with the easiest fix possible. Start with working on speed off of your chest. For raw
lifters this is often over looked. Doing paused pressing will certainly help. One movement I have
found to be the most helpful is to incorporate dead pin presses. The best way to set this up is in a
squat rack. Place the safety rack so the bar will be directly on your chest as you lay on the bench.
Start with about 70% of your max on the bench. You can add more weight as needed. Or you can
also place chains on the bar to increase your work load at the top of the lift. Keep in mind each
rep should come to a complete stop and wait a brief second before blasting your next rep. The
Alpha Project that will be releasing soon calls for doing sets of 3 reps. You will find quickly that
this will really force you to work on explosiveness off your chest. Another way to work on this
portion of the lift is to grab a sling shot and work with about 125% of your max. Be sure to pause
each rep on your chest for a solid 2 count. This will ensure that you are getting all momentum off
of the press and solely working on blasting the bar out of the bottom.

Don’t start worrying about grabbing boards and incorporating lock out work. That isn’t the
problem. If we examine how you lift off of a three or four board press you are typically much
stronger, so if that is the case why are we not blasting through the last 20% of the lift? The
reason is simple. Without speed or explosiveness off your chest you are doomed because you
will never reach that last 20% of the lift you’ve worked so hard on with your lockouts.
If you’re stubborn and you still love 3 or 4 boards, that’s fine. Doing lock out work is better than
doing nothing. Ask yourself if board work helps you with your raw bench? It is important to have
an expectation from each set, each movement and each workout. Without having that expectation
you may not be getting everything out of each workout. That means you are not reaching your
potential.




    Tony Conyers benched an impressive 400 pounds at a bodyweight of 160 at the Master’s!

The second portion of failing half way up would fall under technique. The Alpha Project calls for
rotating each week from a heavy bench to lighter bench week. Only working up to 75%, this is the
time to make the technique adjustments. We are dealing with a percentage that is high enough
that we feel the weight, but light enough to make adjustments. These adjustments can be keeping
your elbows in, flaring at the correct time, and activating your lats. Learning to correct certain
technique flaws will certainly take time. And with help from lift off partners or by recording your
lifts you will be able correct these simple adjustments.

In conclusion, don’t continue something that you aren’t meeting goals with. Examine your
training and have an expectation for what you are doing in the gym. Understand what movements
best fit you and your goals. And finally always be Alpha; don’t be the sheep.

As I write the April issue of STRONG LIFE, it is hard to believe how many years have passed.
Most of today's lifters will not even recognize these names, but if it was not for these folks there
would be no powerlifting today.

We will pick up where we left off in the last issue.

At a Virginia Beach power meet the great arm wrestler, Steve Stanaway, benched 430 at 198, and
heavyweight Russ Fletcher totaled 1750. The American Records which appeared in the August
1968 issue of Muscular Development (MD) had three lifters holding records in more than one
weight class. Dave Moyer still held the squat record at 124 and 132, Enrique Hernandez held the
bench record in those weight classes. Ronnie Ray held the bench record at 181 and 198. George
Crawford's name appeared for the first time.

Gary Young upped the 242 pound Deadlift record to 770, and in the same meet, future American
Record Holder in the Olympic Lifts, Ken Patera, won the Supers with a 1540 total.




                                              Ken Patera

Felix Gomes, at an open meet in Scranton, took the Deadlift Record back with a lift of 658 pounds.
At the time, I could not believe someone his weight could pull that much. Mike Mac Donald
benched 405 at 198 in a meet at the Downtown YMCA in St. Paul, MN.

At this time there was a strange rule on the books that stated "you could not set a record if no one
else lifted in your weight class.". This rule cost Mel Hennessey a Bench Record. Lots of strange
rules, in the deadlift feet had to be shoulder width apart, there was no sumo.

Steroids were being more openly discussed. Muscular Development ran an article "Steroids
Good or Bad?" They did not endorse steroid usage, but stated one should be under a doctor's
care and in low doses and short durations.
The Juniors in Scranton had eighty lifters, the largest turnout to date. Milt McKinney at 123, Jack
Keammerer at 132, Brian Wamsley at 148, Ron Hale at 165, Jesse Hurst (no wraps) at 181, John
Dzurenko at 198, Lee Merritts at 242, and John Ramsey at Super were the winners. Larry Pacifico
again finished second at 181.




                                          Larry Pacifico

The Seniors took place in Los Angeles. In reviewing the pictures from this meet, it was easy to
determine who was and who was not wrapping. Many lifters looked like the Michelin Man. Six
different lifters set squat records.

Junior Champion Milt McKinney, took the 123s. Allan Lord, with a 450 squat and a 520 deadlift,
took the 132s. Bill Thurber and Len Ingro, both from California, won the 148s and 165s and both
set squat records.

Ronnie Ray, lifting without wraps, took the 198s with a big 480 bench. Jon Cole, making his first
Seniors appearance, took the 242s, but John Kanter had the best squat in that class with 740.
Don Cundy took his second Seniors title at Super.

From the end of 1968 and through most of 1969 the controversy over wraps continued. Looking
at today's lifting, such a discussion is still ongoing.

In 1969, York was again hosting the Seniors, and advance word went out that the wrapping would
not be allowed. The Juniors were originally scheduled for Jefferson City, MO, but they could not
put the meet together, and it appeared there would be no Juniors that year. At the last minute,
Les Cramer from Erie, PA, stepped up and volunteered to hold the meet.
        Les Cramer, now in his seventies, moved HUGE weight at R.A.W. United’s Masters
                                        Championships!

The bundling issue continued. An article in MD described how it was done. Back then the lifter
had to make his own gear, but now the equipment companies do it for them. Keep in mind that
many lifters did not do this. Many lifted without any wraps. The way to do it was start with knees.
First put some padding on them, because ace bandages could really hurt. Then apply a rubber
knee support, and after that two or three pairs of ace bandages. You would then put on a very
tight and neatly tailored pair of cutoff jeans. Then the bed sheets would start from the upper
thighs and go all the way up to the chest. This is why guys weighing 181 looked like the Supers.

There was no simple solution to deal with this issue. There were discussions and attempts to
rewrite the rules. The June AAU Conference concluded there would be no wrapping at the
Seniors. If someone was caught with excessive wraps the penalty was removal, but no more. I
really think this problem caused the officials at that time to take a look at other areas. Bar
placement on the back was often called. Arching and chest sink in the bench and any foot
movement in any of the lifts were watched closely.

Records continued to fall. At the Phoenix Open, Jack Barnes at 198 squatted 714 and totaled
1740. At the same meet, John Kanter at 242 bench pressed 539, squatted 764, and totaled 2000 for
three American Records. He was the first 242 pound lifter to total 2000.

Tom Overholtzer, in a California Meet as a 198 pounder, squatted 674 and totaled 1675 for new
records.
Jim Williams had Pat Casey's Bench record in his sights. His goal was to set the record so high
that it would stand the test of time. A lifter in Arizona named Wayne Coleman benched 575. He
was later known as "Superstar" Billy Graham.

Early in the year, Vince Anello pulled 675 at the Great Lakes Open. Future Olympic competitor
and World's Strongest Man, Bruce Wilhelm, totaled 1635 at the Pacific Coast power meet.




                                          Vince Anello

MD ran a Top Ten listing for lifts done in 1968. Guess who compiled the list? Herb Glossbrenner;
MD and Muscle Builder were running more and more articles dealing with power training.

There was some discussion to add a 114 pound weight class.




                                           Fred Glass

The Juniors took place in Erie, PA in August. They had 76 lifters and the meet went well. Phil
Trujillo took the 123s with my old buddy, Fred Glass, finishing second and deadlifting a meet
record of 450. Frank Riley of Chicago took the 132s. Jack Welch, with a new total record, took the
148s. The winner at 165 was New Jersey's Bill Burtis. Carlos Looper of Indiana captured the
181s. Future World Champion, Vince Anello, was 6th in this class. Larry Pacifico moved up to
198 in a big way. He totaled 1700 for a new National Record and Best Lifter Award. Hugh Cassidy
and Russ Fletcher were winners at 242 and Super.

                   This month’s segment was rather short, but we will have …

Known as “Wonder Woman,” Kimberly Clark is a top junior lifter, winning back to back World
titles. Known for her deadlift, Kim is currently training for her third consecutive World title. A
drug free lifter and devout Catholic, Kim was recently interviewed by Paul deSimone.




AUTHOR:        So Kim how many years have you been working out prior to your training for
               powerlifting?

KIM:           I trained for one year at a powerlifting gym - go figure. My friend Jenny Lee
               brought me to Gym Warriors, which was on the total opposite side of my town. I
               got to train with you, Mr. Paul DeSimone, and you made me throw up.

AUTHOR:        I had to laugh because I remember the first day you came in. You guys kept saying
               you wanted a little more so I decided to make you do sprints. Bad idea - I
               remember you with your hand over your face running to the bathroom.

KIM:           Yeah, you made me throw up. I was pretty embarrassed, but I still returned the next
               day.

AUTHOR:        I know that you had no sports back ground; what did you do growing up for
               activities?

KIM:           I danced for 18 years and was also captain of the cheerleading squad.

AUTHOR:        What do you like about powerlifting is it the competition aspect or something else?

KIM:           I like going to competitions where other girls are; I like competing against them. I
               don’t like the small competitions that have no one in my weight class. I think that’s
               stupid; it’s not worth me competing against no one. I do better when I have
               someone to compete against.
AUTHOR:   I also know that you’re sponsored by PDG supplements. How do you like the
          supplements?

KIM:      I really like the Cla - that one helps me get to my weight class. For a while I was up
          to 175 and I needed to drop some pounds; that helps and it’s natural. The Creatine
          is good for strength gains and the glutamine definitely helps you recover quicker.
          But that’s pretty much all I take, and most of the time I forget to take it (starts
          laughing).

AUTHOR:   What made you do the NGA bodybuilding competition?

KIM:      First of all it was local and it had a few girls in the contest. I wanted to challenge
          myself to get into better shape, follow a diet and supplement plan. I also love
          reading those magazines. I don’t just want to be a strong woman. I also want to
          look good.

AUTHOR:   You were asked to do Americas got talent show? I heard through the grape vine
          that you guys had to go to an audition and then you had to submit videos?

KIM:      Yes; it was nerve racking. I had to do reps on the deadlift for the show. I dressed
          up as Wonder Woman and did a whole lifting routine and interview for the show.
          We met with producers, but when the smoke cleared I guess they didn’t think
          powerlifting was a good fit for the show.




AUTHOR:   So were you surprised to have had so much success so early?

KIM:      Well first of all I want to thank God, my family, and my trainer. But I do work hard
          and I train 5-6 times a week every week. I still haven’t been able to go to Disney
          World! I would like to change that because I really want to go!
AUTHOR:       What do you want to see happen to powerlifting in the next few years?

KIM:          I want girls to have more opportunities financially so more girls will compete.
              Women don’t make as much money as men, and it’s harder to afford all this
              training. Yes, you still charge me!

AUTHOR:       Last question - what do you want everyone to know about you that they would not
              know?

KIM:          I love to sing and I am very funny. Well, at least people tell me I am very funny
              once they get to know me.

PUT ON THE FULL ARMOR OF GOD!

“Finally, my brothers, be strong in the Lord and the power of
His might. Put on the whole armor of God that you may be
able to stand against the wiles of the devil. For we do not
wrestle against flesh and blood, but against principalities,
against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this
age, against spiritual hosts of wickedness in the heavenly
places. Therefore take up the whole armor of God, that you
may be able to withstand in the evil day, and having done all,
to stand.”
