Contest Review:
2009 Q-WEST Powerlifting Quest 1000
Qaayarah Airfield, Iraq

Glory to God!
Hosted by United States Army Sergeant Shawn Casey at Iraq’s Qaayarah Airfield, the Q-West Powerlifting Quest 1000 was the second meet sponsored by R.A.W. United for our soldiers serving in the Global War on Terrorism.

Despite losing over half the roster to a mission (and we are thankful to report that all the warriors returned back to their base safely), Shawn brought several quality lifters to the platform.  Army Specialist Benjamin Rodriquez captured Best Lifter honors in the lightweights, going 420, 260, 455 at a bodyweight of 146 pounds.  Benjamin’s 1115 total was an awesome 7.63 times his bodyweight!  In the heavyweights, Private First Class Joseph Zimmerman edged out JP Jenkins (a civilian contractor supporting our troops) for Best Lifter honors.  Although JP out totaled Joseph in the 242s by 25 pounds, Joseph lifted 6.22 times his bodyweight to JP’s 6.19; both Joseph and JP lifted extremely well, and congratulations are due to both!

Special thanks to Sir Charles Venturella for the 12” x 16” plaques; to Brigid and the folks at Sandpiper Sportswear for the R.A.W. United Valiant Warrior contest shirts; and to our members for their generous financial support of the Q-West Powerlifting Quest 1000.  More importantly, thanks to the competitors and those that supported Shawn at the meet.  Our nation can never repay you for the selfless sacrifice that you and your families are making – thank you!  And most importantly, thanks to our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ for making this all happen!

2009 Mid-Atlantic Open 
The Sports Inn * Greencastle, PA

Who do you lift for?
The second annual Mid-Atlantic Open brought many new lifters to the federation, and set the foundation for bigger meets in the state.  R.A.W. United Chaplain Paul Simmons led those in attendance in prayer, reminding us all that our strength is given to us from above.

“Beautiful Girl” Angie Davis led the women’s charge, posting record lifts and capturing Best Lifters honors.  Angie was joined on the platform by newcomers Michelle Johnston, Paula Hopkins, and Kim Hopkins.  At 76 years young, “Dr. Pat” Patalinghug inspired the crowd and set the tone for armed forces veteran and master lifter Rich Murray of Mercersburg, Pennsylvania.  Competing in the 40-44, 148s, Rich posted record lifts 365, 315, and 435 to take first place and Best Lifter honors.  Sports Gym legends Jerry Osborne (65-69, 165s), Ed Lough (55-59, 181s), and Doc Junkins (65-69, 198s) set the tone in the middleweights.  All three master lifters set records, and geared up first-time lifter Nick Montgomery of Franklinville, New Jersey (50-54, 198s) to pull a personal best 390 deadlift.  Home Team Fitness team leader Chad Smith of Hagerstown, Maryland nailed record lifts in the 181s without a belt, and Jonathan Simmons, a Special Olympian from Farmville, Virginia, was nearly flawless on the platform with successful fourth attempts in the squat (300) and deadlift (405) that brought the crowd to its feet!  Veteran lifter Dave Lhota pulled double-duty as head judge and competitor, nailing a 425 squat and 340 bench before his shoulder gave out on his 365-pound deadlift opener (Larry Bucchioni is sending Dave a tube of Ben Gay to celebrate his ascension into the 55-59 year old age group!).   Finally, junior sensation Zack Spidel buried a 650-pound squat, nailed a 565-pound bench, and pulled a 700-pound deadlift to post the largest total to date in the 308-pound class at 1915 pounds!

Many thanks to Frank Thomas and the staff at the Sports Inn in Greencastle, Pennsylvania for hosting the meet; Doc Junkins and Zack Spidel for helping organize the contest; Dave Lhota, John Polak, Paul Simmons, and Doc Junkins for officiating; Kevin Prosser, Jerry Osborne, Jr., Shane XXX, and Joe Montgomery for spotting and loading; John Polak of PolakMade Hardcore Gym Equipment for the platform equipment; Rich Murphy for the PA system; Lori Michaels for scoring; Charles Venturella for the awesome “United We Stand” plaques; Brigid and the folks at Sandpiper Sportswear for the “God Bless America” shirts in “Steeler Black and Gold”; to the Barry Shatzer Fan Club for cheering Barry and all the lifters on; and to all of our lifters for supporting the mission of R.A.W. United!

More thanks to America’s finest – the brave men and women of the United States Armed Forces!  Thanks to each of you we can pray, fellowship, compete, and break bread in the greatest country on earth! And, most importantly, thanks to our King and Creator Jesus Christ whose example teaches us that TRUE STRENGTH is truly found in selfless service and sacrifice.

2009 South Florida Open
Tropical Fitness Gym * Deerfield Beach, FL

Praise God!
Outstanding lifting was demonstrated by Masters Champions Bob Gaynor and Greg Wright, as well as Teenage Champion Amanda Graham at the 2009 South Florida Open.  Bob captured Best Lifter honors in the newly established RAW division with lifts of 500, 360, and 630 in the 60-64, 198s.  Greg’s 1335 total in the 45-49, 181s set a new standard in the class, and won him first place.  RAW Unity competitor Amanda Graham fought off the flu to post lifts of 177, 90, and 225 in the 105s to take Best Lifter honors for the women.  Jorge Bianchi, lifting in his first meet, took both the IRONMAN Best Lifter award and first place in the 181s with his 957 total.  In addition, John Ianno nailed lifts of 330, 265, and 460 to win the RAW division in the 165s.  John was joined in the 165s by Say Tan, a citizen of Singapore and member of his country’s Navy; Say posted an impressive 1015 total in his R.A.W. United debut.  Craig Butler, representing World’s Gym in Fort Lauderdale, posted lifts of 440, 245, and 475 to win the RAW, 30-34,181s, and submaster Seth Fromberg joined Bob in keeping the crowd energized with his 635 pound deadlift.
