Contest Review:
2009 Florida States & Southeast Regionals
West Shore Jr./Sr. High School * Melbourne, FL

Praise God!
Awesome lifting throughout the weekend made the 2009 Florida State / Southeast Regional Powerlifting Championships an overwhelming success!  But first, please say a prayer for our brave men and women serving in harm’s way defending our freedom as American citizens.  And, I am pleased to announce that sufficient monies were raised to sponsor our third meet in Iraq scheduled to take place on August 16th at the Qaayarah Airfield!

Teenagers Amanda Graham and Samantha Shores led the women’s charge.  Both girls won Best Lifters honors, with Amanda taking the IRONMAN division and Samantha winning the RAW division.  Wildcat teammate Kathleen Audet also had an impressive day, with personal bests across the board in the 114s.

On the men’s side, Florida RAW Dog sensation Beau Moore lifted up the Lord while nailing a 730 pound squat, 575 pound bench, and 775 pound deadlift!  Beau’s 2080 total moved him into the top three in the PL Watch rankings; Beau will be guest lifting at the 2009 R.A.W. United Armed Forces Championships (September 11-13) in an effort to break 2100 before the 2010 RAW Unity Meet.  Master lifters Bob Gaynor (60-64) and Bob Benedix (45-49), put on quite a show in the 198s.  Both lifters were representing Worlds Gym in Port Saint Lucie, Florida; Bob Sr. edged out Bob Jr. for RAW Best Lifter honors on Saturday by a score of 7.56 to 7.53.  Orlando Barbell lifter Tyler Hardy won RAW Best Lifter honors on Sunday with lifts of 360, 335, 405 in the 148s.  University of Florida student Corey Clark took home the IRONMAN Best Award (1360 total in the 198s), and Shawn O’Grady of Satellite Beach, Florida registered the top lifts in the Push/Pull division (148 lb. class; 315, 425).

Thanks to JD Gaynor, Fred Goldberg, Pat O’Grady, Dan Carpenter, Caryn Tshontikidis, Bob Gaynor, Jack Stevens, and Bob Lacey for officiating; Anthony DiBiase, Yanni Tshontikidis, and Wolfgang Kermer for spotting and loading; Larry Bucchioni for expediting; Shawn O’Grady for the use of his Okie deadlift bar (it left a lasting impression on Beau’s callous!); Denise Graham and Sam Gough for announcing and running the score table; Georg Baker for photography; Terra Hudnall, Evan Hudnall, and Sava Tshontikidis for running the Dollar Store; Beau Moore, Bill Beekely, and Tim Burns for helping me move equipment Friday evening (a story in itself!); Todd Curry for running the House of Pain booth; and to everyone that helped break down the gym after the meet was over!

More thanks to Sir Charles Venturella for the awesome eagle sculptures; Brigid and the folks at Sandpiper Sportswear for the incredible contest shirts (the design was so awesome that it has become the federation’s new logo); Mike Roebuck of Good Impressions printing for the certificates; and the folks at Bodybuilding.com for the knee sleeves and shirt!

Even more thanks to Dr. Jeff Sevor and everyone that competed; as a result of your participation and heartfelt donations, the federation will be able to sponsor our August 16th meet in Iraq!

Most importantly, thanks to America’s warriors for their selfless service and sacrifice; may God bring each of you home safely!  And eternal thanks to our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ for making this all possible!
