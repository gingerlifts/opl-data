                          2011 Support the Troops Benefit Meet
                                 Saturday, November 5
                           Olympic Gym * San Antonio, Texas
                                                The Lord is our Strength!
The 2011 Support the Troops Benefit Meet defined why gym meets are so fun! Holding our first meet at San Antonio’s
Olympic Gym in the great state of Texas, it was standing-room-only from start to finish! And thanks to powerlifting
legends Jill Mills and Gene Bell, the contest ran extremely smooth while funds were raised to support Wounded Warrior
Project (www.woundedwarriorproject.org).

On the women’s side, Chelsea Warren shattered the record books with a 275 pound squat, a 150 pound bench, and the
360 pound deadlifted pictured below. Chelsea even joined our federation tradition and enjoyed a “Cuba Libre” cigar to
celebrate her efforts!

The contest also saw the return of 2002 World’s Strongest Woman Jill Mills to the competitive platform. I had the
pleasure of meeting Jill earlier this year and Extremity Games, and she was instrumental in introducing me to Olympic
Gym owner J.D. Wennermark and Gene, putting together the incredible crew that supported the meet, and helping me
host our first meet in the Lone Star State. Jill was nursing an injured elbow, but nonetheless spotted, loaded, and judged
before pulling an easy 530 pound deadlift pictured below. It is important to note that Jill’s best deadlift ever was 562, and
she had plenty in the tank with her 530 pound effort. With the 2012 RAW Unity Meet just around the corner, all we can
say is, “LOOK OUT!”

Hailing from Copperas Cove, Texas, thirteen-year-old Junior Fridline led the men’s charge, posting record lifts across the
board in the 105s; pictured below is Junior ripping a 160 pound record deadlift!

As defined in the contest title, the meet was scheduled as a fundraiser for Wounded Warrior Project. Several warriors
from WWP’s TRACK Program (a twelve-month education and employment program) competed for the first time, to
include Operation Iraqi Freedom veterans Alan Busby and Evan Hudec.

Olympic Gym lifter Jesse Noell, an active duty soldier currently stationed at Brooke Army Medical Center, registered an
impressive 1225 pound total that included the 550 pound deadlift pictured below.

Joining Jesse in the 198s were Operation Iraqi Freedom veterans Jacob Tabora and Luis Chavez, as well as TRACK’s
Marcus Washington who serves our warriors as the program’s APEX Peak Performance Director.

All three lifters competed for the first time, and we look forward to seeing their numbers climb at our next meet at Olympic
Gym in February.

The 220s consisted of three more TRACK students – Michael Gallardo, Charlie Huffstuttler, and Mike Bavo. All served in
Iraq before becoming a part of Wounded Warrior Project; Michael and Charlie competed in the full power division and
Mike, who is currently interning at Olympic Gym, entered the push/pull.

In the 242s, Jeremy King of Huntsville, Texas and David Martinez of Corpus Christ, Texas had record breaking days.
Jeremy was flawless on the platform, going nine for nine with lifts of 500 in the squat, 425 in the bench, and 575 in the
deadlift.

David attended the meet in hopes of hitting a qualifying bench for the 2012 RAW Unity Meet. After missing his first two
attempts, David came back and nailed the 465 pound bench pictured below.

Wounded Warrior Zech Gray had planned to just bench, but switched to the push/pull during warm-ups; he is pictured
below finishing the day strong with a 425 pound deadlift.
