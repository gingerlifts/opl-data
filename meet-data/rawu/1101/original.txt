                  2011 UPF CHALLENGE
                              Saturday, June 11
               Universal Power & Fitness Gym * Orlando, Florida
The fourth annual UPF Challenge saw its biggest turnout to date, with 50
registered lifters converging on Zied Hichri’s Universal Power & Fitness
Gym in Orlando, Florida. Special thanks to all who participated and, more
importantly, for helping R.A.W. United raise funds for both the Jackson
Springs     Recreation    Center    and    Wounded    Warrior     Project
(www.woundedwarriorproject.org)!

Special thanks to Zied Hichri, owner of Universal Power & Fitness for
being a great host and friend!    And we wish Zied and Tonya all of God’s
blessings as they are soon to be proud parents!

Many thanks to Jack Stevens, Brian Kissel, Albert Smith, Jodi Simmons, Bob
Gaynor, Brian Burritt, Pete Classon, Larry Dromerhauser, Zied Hichri, and
Michael Francis for judging; Zied and Tonya for keep the Juice Bar open
throughout the meet; Brian Kissel, Tom Toomey, and Scott Carey for
scoring; Robbie, Tristen, Larry, Pete, and many others for spotting and
loading; Sandpiper Sportswear for the awesome R.A.W. United shirts; and
Sir Charles Venturella for the awards and sculptures!

Before we discuss the contest, please say a prayer for our troops and for
the family of powerlifting legend Al Siegel.    Al was a great mentor and
friend, and his passing will be felt in the powerlifting community.

Alex Seymour of Peachtree City, Georgia led the Youth charge, securing
Best Lifter honors on lifts of 130, 95, and 180 in the 10-11, 105s. Alex
was joined on the platform by his brother Zac, veteran lifters Leo and
Joseph Simmons, and newcomer Max Blessing.        All five youth lifters
demonstrated awesome technique and poise on the platform; well done!
 Teenage lifter Joseph Townsend of Lakeland, Florida was flawless on the
                                 platform

Teenage lifters Joseph Townsend and Tim Acfalle, both from Lakeland,
Florida, took home Best Lifter awards in the full power and push/pull
categories. Joseph went nine for nine, registering lifts of 365, 290, and
425 for an impressive 1080 total in the 18-19, 198, IRONMAN division (no
belt).    Tim totaled nearly four times his bodyweight on two lifts,
benching 205 and deadlifting 280 in the 18-19, 132s.




  ANIMAL Nutrition Products representative Jeremy Bennett moved massive
                                 weight,
           registering a 1005 total in the Push/Pull category!

On the women’s side, Karen Barone of Indialantic, Florida captured Best
Lifter Honors in the full power category, and UPF lifter Sarah Lee won top
billing in the push/pull.    Both ladies were making their R.A.W. United
debut, and lifted extremely well.      Karen had a perfect day, setting
records across the board en route to her 465 total. Sarah only missed her
final bench, posting a 95 pound bench and a 200 pound deadlift in the
123s.
 IRONMAN Best Lifter Donald Beasock of Ocala, Florida registered an awesome
                           1265 total in the 181s
Donald Beasock and Jordan Wong owned the platform in their respective
divisions. Lifting IRONMAN without a belt, Don nailed a 450 squat, a 315
bench, and a 500 deadlift to shatter the record books and capture Best
Lifter honors. Jordan Wong, who recently moved into the junior age group,
continues to grow stronger and stronger.     Competing in the 20-24, 242s,
Jordan went 615 (with a near miss at 640), 405, and 610 for an impressive
1630 total and Best Lifter honors in the RAW division.
  UPF lifter Michael “Shotgun” Francis pulling 770 pounds in the 50-54,
                                  275s!

UPF Michael “Shotgun” Francis registered a 1205 push/pull total on lifts
of 435 and 770 to take home the top prize, and veteran bencher Christian
Corey dropped 32 pounds to break the 65-69, 181 bench record at 285
pounds.

Outstanding full power performances were also displayed by UPF lifters
Avery Merwether and JR Najar, Tampa, Florida’s Sean Carter, and Sean
Mathison of Samson Strength & Conditioning in Port Saint Lucie, Florida.
Jan Pierce of Orange Park, Florida was back on the platform in the
push/pull category after a long hiatus, and benchers Michael Renfroe of
Thomasville, Georgia and Stephen Pignato of Hudson, Florida displayed
great power.

Finally, thanks to all of our military heroes that participated, to
include but not limited to: Mike Alderman, Anthony Busby, Pernell Bush,
Scott Carey, Ron Crawford, Bill McGuire, John Ruffalo, Albert Smith, and
Tom Toomey.    Thanks for your service and selfless sacrifice; may God
richly bless you and your family!
