Contest Review:
2009 Armed Forces Open
“THE GYM” * Melbourne, Florida

Who do you lift for?
High-octane energy permeated “THE GYM” for the second annual Armed Forces Open sanctioned and sponsored by R.A.W. United!  Active duty personnel, reservists and guardsmen, veterans, and patriotic Americans shared the platform for a weekend of lifting and camaraderie.

Before we begin, please say a prayer for our brave men and women serving in the Global War on Terrorism.  Thanks to their service, we were able to host this contest and honor present and past members of the United States Armed Forces.

Seven ladies competed at the meet, and records fell in across the board.  Teenage lifters Kathleen Audet, Amanda Graham, and Samantha Shores, who are all preparing for the 2010 RAW Unity Meet, made the switch to sumo-style deadlifts along with Amanda’s mom, Denise, for this meet, and will have their totals “back to normal” before the end of the year.  Kathleen and Samantha also nailed record squats at 165 and 200 pounds, respectively.  Moriah Douglas, an eighth grader at West Shore Junior/Senior High School, pulled a 175 pound record deadlift, and Brielle Levels and Stacie Deutsch were flawless in their R.A.W. United debut.

On the men’s side, RAW Unity director Eric Talmant, a former member of the Navy’s Special Warfare Center, reached the 1400 pound barrier in the 165s with lifts of 490, 280, and 630.  Eric’s total was 8.5 times his bodyweight and won him Best Lifter honors as well!  Stephen King, representing the United States Army, drove down from Fort Bragg to nail lifts of 405, 330, and 505 to secure Best Lifter honors for active duty personnel.  Masters Champion Beau Moore of the Florida RAW Dawgs was aiming for a 2100+ pound total, but was unable to hang on to an 800 pound deadlift attempt; Beau did, however, register a 755 pound squat and 570 pound bench.  United States Air Force veteran Shawn O’Grady captured Best Lifter honors in the Push/Pull division with lifts of 315 and 425 in the 148s, and Coast Guard veteran George Walker was the outstanding bencher with his 345 pound bench in the 60-64, 198s.  In addition, ten-year-old Evan Pittman (whose father, Hal, is a U.S. Navy Admiral stationed at MacDill Air Force Base) was a crowd pleaser, posting a 67 pound, record bench and a 180 pound, record deadlift in the 77 pound class.  

Thanks to Bob Gaynor, Jack Stevens, JD Gaynor, Sam Gough, and Caryn Tshontikidis for judging; Wolfgang Kermer, Pete Classon, Steve Ryder, Steve Shores, and Yanni Tshontikids for spotting/loading; Yanni Tshontikidis, Russell Zirkle, and Stephen King for set-up; and Wolfgang Kermer, Steve Ryder, Steve Shores, Samantha Shores, Stephanie Shores, Sandy Shores, Denise Graham, Amanda Graham, Sam Gough, and Kathleen Audet for clean-up.

Even more thanks to the military personnel that competed and to those currently serving our great nation.  We can never say “thanks” enough to you and your families for your courage and sacrifice.  May God always watch over you!

And finally, thanks to our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ – no matter what we accomplish on or off the platform, NOTHING COMPARES to the greatness of knowing You!

God Bless, Spero
