# Probes the CPU main page for new meets.
# The CPU updated their website and removed raw database access.
#
# On the new site, in order to look up a meet in the database, you need
# to either already know its full name or know a lifter in that meet.
# The CPU pulls a "Latest Results" list from the database and shows that on
# the main page. So we can use that to pick up some of the new ones.
# We would miss any meets that take a while to post.
