                                    A TRIBUTE TO DAN MILLER


It was a great day of lifting at Lancaster’s Party House in Clyde, New York, the official host of the AAU
New York State Bench / Deadlift Championship. There were many state records set on this day as you
can see from the list above. I congratulate each one of them, but this day was dedicated to the memory of
Dan Miller. Dan was a 26 year old 220# deadlifter with a rock solid body. He passed away earlier this
year of a brain aneurysm. He was a terrific person, friend and lifter. He will be sadly missed by all those
who knew him. He held the 220# RAW deadlift record with 605#. At the meet we loaded the bar at 605#
and held a moment of silence. After that a plaque of his 605# deadlift was dedicated to the gym where he
lifted, Maximum Fitness. A lifter of the meet trophy was presented to Mark Harrison who had his
personal best deadlift at 550#. I knew Dan a few years and we had talked a number of times. I
remember how shocked he was when I gave him the videotape of his 605# deadlift. He could not believe
how quickly I had got it for him. He was thankful and smiling. Dan, somehow things will not be the
same but we know you will be looking down at every New York state AAU meet and smiling. I feel that
your record will stand for a long time. Also one week prior to the States, I learned that my brother had
passed away so it was a tough emotional day for me. I will address my brothers passing in the next meet
summary. My lifting will be dedicated to my brother, my friend Fred Rogers. I would as always like to
thank my crew Terry Stafford, Jason Stafford, Rich Molisani, RL Murray, Mark Howell, Jim Lee for their
dedication in helping get the meet off every time. I love you guys, you are the best!! Thanks to my wife
Michelle who I would not do these meets without her. Special thanks to Lancaster’s Party House for a
great facility and food venue for the lifters and their families. Well until next time, train hard and drug
free.
