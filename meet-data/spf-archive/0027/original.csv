"SPF Teenage Powerlifting Championship 1/26/08 Hartford, Al.  We would like to thank everyone for coming out and making this a great day of Powerlifting. We thank Scotty Cox and his wife Heather for hosting this event and doing a great job running the show. Scotty is also the Alabama State Chairman for the SPF. We would especially like to thank Andy Bowen for bringing out his team which is always growing and getting better and better. Thanks goes out to Bobby Myers for all he does for the SPF, Bobby is the New Florida State Chairman.  A great big thanks goes out to Carol Ann Myers. Carol Ann was invited by the Teenage girls on Andy Bowens Team and myself to come and lift at this event so we could see first hand just what a great lifter she really is. Carol was using this event as a warm up for another meet in 2 weeks so she did not go ALL OUT on any of her lifts but still put up some great numbers. She opened up on the Squats with 325 went to 375 and finished with an easy 400 lb. for the day. This is the biggest Squat ever made by a woman in any Federation RAW in the 148 lb. weight Class.  Thanks goes out to the Loader/Spotters, for the great job they done,and as always lift more weight than anyone in the room, Also the Judges, great job well done. There were a lot of BIG numbers hit by these Teenagers all day and was very exciting to watch.    SPF President   Jesse Rodgers  Raw powerlifting  Special Guest: Womens Div. 148 lb.
