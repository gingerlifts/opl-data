"8/16/08 Arkansas State Powerlifting and Bench Press Championship Russellville, Arkansas  Terry Tucker as the meet director along with Jeff Phillips and Jamie McDougal as Co-Directors put on an incredible meet Saturday. It was there first meet ever directing for the SPF and what a great job they did in there on home town of Russellville, Ar. This meet was put on in the Russellville Junior High School Gym. Not only a HUGE place, but extremely nice, even had there own warm up room already there. Judging was great and even across the board, Spotters and loaders were great, no one dropped a bar and there were no miss loads. Terry and the Top Hogs had plenty of help to do what ever needed to be done, even the Top Hogs that were lifting were still on hand to help out anywhere they were need. Lori Elem done a great job announcing and helping out Victoria Rodgers at the Score table which left me with pretty much nothing to do but walk around and watch a great job in progress. We had a great and lively crowd that cheered thes guy on all day long. Again, from start to finish, I couldn't ask for a better ran meet. Everyone kept asking my wife and I if we would come back to Russellville and our answers were, WE CAN""T WAIT. So Dec.6th. we will be back in Russellville with the Top Hogs to do it all over again with the SPF Strongest in the South. If you want to take part in a great meet be sure to be there, you won't be sorry.  Jesse Rodgers",,,,,,,,
