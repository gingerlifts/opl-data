"3/07/09 Alabama State Powerlifting Championship Power House Gym Albertville, Alabama  A huge thank you goes out to the Power House Gym for hosting the SPF Alabama State Powerlifting Championship for us. We had a great turn out for the first meet here in this area.  Thanks also goes out to all the lifters that took time to train and take part in the event. We can not do what we do without you. Also we had a great turn out of people that came to watch and be a part of this event, thank you everyone.  A special thanks goes out to Thomas Snellings, for setting all this up and over seeing it from start to finish. Thomas has been appointed the new Northern Alabama State Chairman and will do a great job I am sure.  We also had a great Team of Judges, Nicky Peppers, Keith Taylor, Melissa Garrett and myself. Everyone done a great job, it is strict and fair straight down the line.  Spotters and Loader as always had the hardest job in the house and also one the most important one keeping everyone safe and keeping the Bars loaded right all day. Job well done and thank each and everyone of you.  Score table and Announcing was Done by my wife Victoria and Melissa Garrett, which have worked together several times and have always do a great job on the Table keeping up with everything that goes on and they are the ones that keep the meet running as well as they do. Thank you.  Amber Suter and her daughter were also there doing there jobs, Amber worked the door and her daughter sold Tee Shirts all day doing a great job at it.
