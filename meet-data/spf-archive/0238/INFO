---2012 Pro/Am Powerlifting Meet---
As always, the Cincinnati Pro/Am Meet was a super success.
On Saturday Jean Forgatsch Fry and Niki Anderson both had a great meet. Jean hit a solid P.R in her squat at 123lbs and Niki had great meet hitting a P.R total in the 181lbs. Great job ladies.
On Pro day, two extraordinary women had an off day. Natalie Carr, the World Record Holder at 123 bodyweight bombed in the squat due to balance with 515. The incomparable, Laura Phelps, after a 710-pound opener could not negotiate a 495-pound bench and was none for the day. Dave Hoff and Joe Jester fell victim to the bombs and left the money door open. In the 220 down class, in fifth place was Bearl and winner of the 198’s; in fourth place Brad Little with 1835-pound total and had a great 730-pound deadlift. Jimmy Pacifico had a 725-lbs personal record. In Second place, Brian Schwab with 1940 in the 165’s on an off day. First, was Westside Barbell’s Jason Coker with a total of 2330. The only person with a 205-pound bodyweight for first place plus best bench for $5,000. The best deadlift was Brad Little and won $1,000.
The big boy came out next lifting in the 308’s Derek Wade. He totaled 2430 for fifth and won $1,000. In fourth, Luke Edwards with 2350-pound total in the 275-pound weight class. In third Josh Conley ,who is Edwards Westside teammate, who made huge progress with a 2590lbs total. This a 100lbs increase from his last meet. In second place, yet another Westside lifter Jake Anderson; a SHW with a 2610-pound total and yes, a Westsider won the heavy weights namely Shane Hammock with 2695lbs at 308lbs.
After the math was done, the champion of champions runner up was Jason Coker and ultimate champ was Shane Hammock, winning $6,800 and a $900 belt. This could very well be the last Pro/Am Meet due to lack of sponsors. But for now, the Ironman in March is the next money meet with a belt as well.

For now, good luck to all.
