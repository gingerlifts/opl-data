SPF Fall Men's Open 2010 Results,"November 06, 2010",,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Athletes from six states attended the Men's Fall Open at Super Training last weekend. We saw some great lifting, with a 2403 pound total by Super Training's own Treston Shull and multiple record setting lifting by 69 year old Salvatore Morabito, a crowd favorite.  Nevada's Dustin Speed took the Raw Heavyweight class with a big 1708 total, and we were also impressed by junior lifter Alex Bergschneider, who showed a lot of poise under pressure and went 9 for 9 on the day! Greg Buffington continues to dominate the Men's Lightweight division, having moved from single ply to multi ply. And California Raw lifter Chris Gallick put in a super 8 for 9 performance to walk away with the win in a huge lightweight class.  Thanks to all the lifters, judges, and spotters and loaders, and other staff who made this a wonderful meet!  Meet Director Cara Westin",,,,,,,,,,,,
