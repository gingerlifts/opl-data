East Tennessee Sports Expo Results,"September 13, 2008",,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,
"Results for East Tn. Sports Expo 9/13/08  First we want to thank everyone that came out and made this meet happen. Thanks to Ginger Nuttermaker and all her people that promoted this event and choice the SPF for the Powerlifting. Thanks to all the Judges, Wade Johnson, Nicky Peppers and Ken Millrany and also thanks to Loader/Spotters, Jacob Byrd and his friend, they lifted more weight than anyone in the house.  As always thanks to Victoria Rodgers for running a perfect Score Table, she is the one that keeps the meet running smooth and perfect. Anyone that knows anything about running meets knows this is the most important job at a meet and as always she does it with ease.  Anyone that wasn't at this meet sure missed a great time and a new experience for the SPF. There was Body Building, Cage Fighting, Belly Dancing and plenty of other entertainment, and believe it or not, even a Gun and Knife show, unbelievable. Plenty of spectators too.",,,,,,,,,
