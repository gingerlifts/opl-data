Could not find missed attempts marked anywhere. Got the results for the 100,110 classes off a youtube video of the event which pans over the scoreboard.
Attempted to mark the succesful squat attempts of the 75,82.5 classes from watching video and found the bench & deadlifts using the subtotals and totals.

The rest of the results were marked based on the subtotals and totals. This lead to ambiguities for the sucessful squat & bench of:

Jean-Paul Soenarman
Stephani Maurice
Eric Yameng
Frederic Maroanui

So had to make guesses as to the most likely sucessful attempts for these athletes.
