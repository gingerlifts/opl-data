"I must say thanks to the following people first before I begin my article about the 2007 Worlds. Thanks to Python Gym, Alan Thomas at APT Wraps, Quest Nutrition and Sherman Ledford. Thanks to my staff because without you this meet would not take place. Many people come up to me and give me credit for a fine meet but it’s everyone on the staff that should be thanked and I THANK ALL OF YOU. Tom Isbell, Annette Schneidmill, Denise Musser, Ron Deamicis, Dina Digrazia, Brian Sessions, Cindy Yeargin, Glenda Klaassen, Lester Fields, Evan Claunch, Mike Watkins, Lionel Howard, William Sessions, Perry Thomas, Steve Yeargin, Matt Elrod, Adrian Locklear, Sheila Ford, Jamie Cooper, Craig and Moms. Thanks to the many spectators that came out to cheer everyone on and a big thank you to the lifters that came from 18 states and 6 countries to make this a World event. Thanks to the Brazilian team and the Republic of Georgia team that came 14 and 10 strong. 28 drug test were done with one failure to report. This lifter will not be able to lift in WNPF events for three years, all records will be removed and he cannot promote the WNPF in any way for the next three years. We will not publish the name of the lifter that failed the test because it is embarrassing enough to get caught.",,,,,

"Onto the World results, the women did a fabulous job again all 26 of them. The one thing that I like to see in the WNPF is how the lifters are pulling for each other even though they are competing against each other. Jeri Keel lifting in her first WNPF Worlds set several records and won her division. I heard that this was going to be her last meet I hope not because Jeri is one of our favorite lifters out of South Carolina. Charlotte Hall from Georgia did very well switching over from bodybuilding to powerlifting. Ms. Longshore from PA. set new records and also won her first WNPF title. Ruth Ann Calais the oldest female lifter totaled 639 pounds, how many 60 year old women can do that. Cathi Mitchell from PA. came to set the World deadlift record and that she did on a 4th attempt. Maria Spano is not doubt the top raw female lifter in the WNPF and it showed once again at the 2007 world championships. Voegeli, Baxter and Greer all did a wonderful job of lifting. There were two female lifters from Brazil that came to show their skills, we could tell that they were new to the sport but they had the courage to step onto the platform and show everyone what they were made of. My daughter Brianna Ford opened up with 40 pounds, then went to 50 and smoked it and then I made a mistake and pushed her up to 60 when she should have went to 55 but I am so proud of her for pressing 50 pounds and weighing 57 pounds. Kady Parker the other 9 year old pushed 55 pounds up in the 80 pound class for a new record. Grossnickle from Indiana won her first WNPF World title in the 105 class. Mondragon and Wilcox out of Florida set new records with 82 and 137 pound lifts. Jean Adams the other 60 year old from NJ set new records in her class also. Laura Feeney from PA. hit 159 pounds raw. She took off several years of lifting and came back this year and she is almost up to her equipped weight from years ago. She lifted with us when she was 16 years old and now she is 25 and she still looks the same. Miller had the highest bench of the contest with a 165 pound lift. Rhonda Sams from GA. had the highest deadlift for the women with a 385 lb. pull. David Cohn from Ga. set all new world records and he is the top 114 pound lifter in the WNPF and don’t worry David we will never get rid of the 114 pound class. Wilcox, Carmichael and Artur showed out. Mike hit a 462 squat, Hugh deadlifted a personal best 501 and Carlos from Brazil posted a 1487 total and the best lifter award. Johnny Gayton came to set some records and that he did going home with 17 WNPF World records. John Monk from PA. had an off day but I’m sure he will be back stronger than ever in the 165’s. Marr and Eisen did extremely well for a couple of teenage kids and they will improve I’m sure. Greg Wright from Florida won the lifetime and masters divisions in the 181’s. Willy Wilcox won the masters raw class, set a few records and coached a bunch of kids on his team. I give this guy a lot of credit for what he did all weekend. Willy is a great coach and lifter. Portwood from GA. set a new world record in the 181 lifetime division. Mike Bishop from TN. Totaled 1471 raw and won the best lifter in the raw division. Steve the old man Yeargin showed out with a 1653 total and Dennis Walmer another WNPF favorite set new squat, bench and total records in the master’s 50-54 division. In the 220 pound junior raw division AZARIASHVILI had a great day with a 1311 total. Newman totaled 1791 in the masters 220 class and he also won the best lifter award. Pedro Tondo out of Canada won by over 200 pounds over Hemperly. The other Newman brother almost hit a 1900 total with single ply equipment on, this is one strong dude. Fambrough from Furman U. hit a 650 squat with no knee wraps and he also set a new world record deadlift in the 275 class. Wayne Alsup won the 50-59 and police divisions. Wayne pulled a bicep on his last deadlift attempt we can only hope that he will recover soon and step back on the WNPF platform in 2008. Jason Wood from AZ. Is a squatting machine!!!! His first squat was right at parallel and got red lighted, his second and this squats were perfect and easy. He has 900 in his sights and it won’t be too long before he hits that. He had the highest total in the meet with a 2,083. This is the highest total in the 275 class ever in the WNPF and the third highest total ever in the WNPF. Jamie Davis had an off day and still totaled almost 1800 pounds. Chad Knowles is the first man to hit a 2,100 total in the WNPF. He is making his comeback to the WNPF and he totaled 1935, he just missed a 750 deadlift which would have put him closer to 2000 pounds. Little Big Man Austin Padgett set world records in both the bench press and deadlift. Petrik from Fl. Hit 92 pounds in the 114 class. Peang from R.I. made a 242 bench in the 123 class raw.

Big Charles Register missed his first two lifts and just barely missed 804 on his third. He came so close to making this lift which would have been the biggest bench in WNPF history, next year for sure big Charles. Rasia from Brazil made an impressive 396 lbs. in the 132 class for the win. Rich Sadiv from NJ made 694 and tried 700 and missed it. Tee Meyers from GA. hit 738 on his third attempt and then went to 760 on a 4th. I wish people in the audience could see themselves when the Skinny Man comes to the platform. It seems as though everyone in the audience just comes forward to get the best spot for pictures and to see this man lift. Tee came out, shouted “I’m the strongest grand daddy in the world” and with everyone screaming for him he pulled 760 so easy he could have easily pulled 771.
