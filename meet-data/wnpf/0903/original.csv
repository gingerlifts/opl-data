"*- NATIONAL RECORD, BL-BEST LIFTER, !- WNPF LIFETIME ORGANIZATION LIFTER",,,,,
,,,,,
"Another great meet by the WNPF and its lifters. 51 lifters from 6 states attended this event with 4 no shows. This meet was the next to last event in the north for lifters to qualify for the WNPF World Championships. We have one more meet in August for lifters to qualify in and then onto the world championships. We had a lot of full meet lifters and still finished up at 3:45pm. Thanks to the WNPF staff for all of their HARD WORK. Thanks to the WNPF lifters that supported this meet. We know times are hard right now for everyone and our numbers are down from last year just like all federations. We do appreciate you supporting the WNPF in these hard times and we will do our best to give you quality events for your money. Top performances by Jessica Scofield from Conn. Pulling 385 lbs in the 165 class. John Tortorelli the oldest lifter in this meet at 76 years old lifting in his first meet did a fabulous job. James Davis showed out in the 220 class totaling over 1700 pounds RAW and Brian Reed recorded the highest deadlift in the meet with a 625 pull. John Keller from Penn State made some nice lifts and this guy is a giant with a 22 rack height. He went down with 650 lbs raw and made it. Brendan Stote from Conn. Made some nice and easy lifts in the junior SHW division. Ms. Rodgers and Corallo lifted well in the women’s bench press division. Both of them will give any and all women a run at the WNPF worlds this year. Nick Maltezos and Tom West did well in the raw bench press divisions. Big Man Halversen from NJ made a nice impression for his first meet. Mr. Cotton would have totaled over 1700 if he had made his 500+ bench but he did well in the other two lifts. Teddy Finland lifted 615 pounds in the masters 50+ division. Teddy has been pulling 600+ for years now and still pulling this massive weight at 50 years old. The little man Sinath Sam won the best lifter award in the powercurl. For some first timers GREAT JOB, Eory, Smith, Gorri, Doc Hash in his first full power meet, Radcliff, Pryor and Kay. Thanks to the many spectators that came out to cheer on everyone, see you guys in August and/or October. (WNPF)",,,,,
