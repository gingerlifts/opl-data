"The 11th World Bench Press, Deadlift Championships and the 2nd Ironman Championships and the 1st Powercurl Championships is over and it was another great meet for the WNPF. We also had a strongman contest on Saturday after the first day of lifting. We held our annual banquet on Saturday night and many lifters and their family members attended the affair. The food was free of charge to all lifters. We had lifters from four countries attend with lifters from India having trouble once again getting to the USA. I want to add that the 2003 World Championships will be in Las Vegas, NV. In October. We had approximately 147 lifters; many putting on great performances and a few missed all of their attempts and bombed out. The judging was fair and strict. Of course the usual happened where lifters thought their lifts should have counted and didnâ€™t and very few lifts slipped by with white lights. The spotters were superb once again with no misleads and protecting all lifters. Thanks to the Park Inn Hotel in Lancaster, thanks to the many lifters and many spectators that came out to cheer everyone on and thanks to the WNPF staff for their wonderful job. Testing was done by urinalysis on a few lifters with all lifters passing. Some lifters will be subjected to out of meet testing for the rest of the year to insure that they are truly drug free. Awards were 15 x 18 plaques with the lifters name on their plaque. Thanks again and we hope to see all of you in 2003 for a better WNPF World Championships in Vegas. (WNPF)",,,,,,
