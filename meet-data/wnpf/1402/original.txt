TEAM CHAMPS- BEV FRANCIS POWERHOUSE GYM- COACH PAUL BUCHABUER

The WNPF moved back to its original location in New Jersey at the Edison Hotel in Edison, NJ. We
started in this place in 1993 and we had our last event there in 2006. I’m very happy to be back at this
facility, all of the lifters were happy with the facility also. We now have 4,500 square feet of space
with a huge warm up room. Harold’s Deli is on site with some great food and there is plenty of parking
for everyone. Many thanks to my WNPF staff for putting on another great event. Thanks to Perry
Thomas and Lou Tortorelli for helping us set up at 6 AM and spotting throughout the meet. Thanks to
the Missing Link Power Team (Thomas Sestilo, Erik Lang, Vito Cirioni, Pete Gisondi JR and Raymond
Smith) for spotting and Loading. Thanks to Dale Glenney, Bob McCloskey, Annette Schneidmill and Eric
Leblanc for Judging. Thanks to Moms and Danette for holding down the door and selling shirts and
thanks to Glenda and Lester for keeping the meet running smoothly. Thanks to Paul Buchbauer for
bringing the Bev Francis Powerhouse Gym Team. There’s going to be a big showdown in December
between them and the Missing Link or will another team emerge as the team champs in December?
We will see. Lifters keep in mind the Sarge McCray meet is always well attended so please have your
entries in early to secure your spot, we will take a maximum of 75 lifters for this meet. We do not
want to go over this number so we can get out by a reasonable time.
