"Wow, what a great event for the WNPF. This was the second WNPF LIFETIME DRUG FREE ALL-RAW event. Last year we had 28 lifters in Warner Robins this year we ended up with 74 lifters in Cocoa Beach, Fl. Lifters from the USA, Guatemala and Puerto Rico attended. We received many complements from the lifters about the location, the contest facility and the meet itself. I just want to first and foremost thank Willy and Willy’s powerhouse garage for all of their help in making this meet a success. Willy had 15+ people help us at the event and we could not have done this meet without their help. I don’t know everyone’s name but they know who they are. I also want to thank our great judges Bob Gaynor, JD and Jack. These guys judged every lift and did an excellent job. I always say that the WNPF will never take a lift from a lifter but they will give you one from time to time. Thanks to Brian Burritt and Adrian Locklear for announcing both days. Thanks to moms Ford for selling shirts, etc. Thanks to House of Pain, Dr. Hoxie (Chiropractor) and our main sponsor Eric Leblanc and Organo Gold Coffee for having tables at the event. Also thanks to Dave Duncan and his crew from Deland. We will be back in November for the 2010 WNPF LIFETIME Worlds and USA vs the World Championships. Now to some highlights- Aaron Chaves will be going in the military soon but this little man benched 325 in the 148 raw and totaled 1060 lbs. Dan Rusk in the 181 teen division posted a 1220 lb raw total. Rachel Wilcox benched 165 raw in the 17-19 division. Greg Wright went 8 for 9 in the 181 raw division and totaled 1350 lbs. Edgar Masters benched 475 lbs in the 181 class, weighing 173 lbs. Willy Wilcox totaled 1265 lbs. but he also loaded weights onto a truck, unloaded weights, coached his lifters and still totaled 1265. Carlos Rijos representing Puerto Rico deadlifted 620 lbs in the 198 class. Zeid Hichri posted a 1740 lb raw total in the 220’s. This is the highest raw total in the 220’s in WNPF history. Troy Kay is becoming a very good teen lifter in the WNPF with a 1210 total at 203 lbs. Dan Shaw made a comeback to the WNPF and impressed everyone with a 480 bench and then went on to a 4th attempt 490 lbs. in the bench. Darrell Banning from AZ. Totaled 1940 in the 275 class. Doug Mignot from PA. is a strong dude, he totaled 1600 but had much more in him. He made everything lok so easy he could have easily totaled 1700. Jason Wood benched 635 lbs in the single ply division. Frank Buzzo is 57 yrs old and weighed 272 lbs. and benched 475 raw. Mike “The Beast” Francis came to pull and that he did. He opened with 700 raw and then went to 800. Mike came so close to locking out 800 lbs. all he had to do was put this shoulders straight at the top. He will no doubt get 800 at the next WNPF event and be the second man in WNPF history to pull 800 lbs. (WNPF)",,,,,
