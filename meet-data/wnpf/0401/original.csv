"Hello to all, world meet number thirteen for the WNPF. I can remember the very first one where had 422 lifters, the biggest meet in powerlifting history and I hope we never have another one of those but that meet put the WNPF on the map. This contest was moved from its original time in the fall to the summer. We ended up with 208 total lifters for a summer time World Championships we were very happy with this turnout. We will move the worlds back to the fall in 2005 and we will be in Orlando, Florida. I want to thank all of the lifters that attended this event from the lifters in the USA to the lifters that came from the Republic of Georgia. We had a total of seven countries attend this year championship. I want to thank my staff for a wonderful job. They are Lester, Denise, Annette, Ron Ehrhardt, Ron Deamicis, Herman, Moses, Bryan, John, Kenny, Perry, Thomas, William, Moms, Steven, Jamie, Buddy, Jim, Adrian, Perry and Tee Meyers. Again, there were a few lifters that were not happy with the judging at the worlds but this happens every year. Our judges do a very good job they are tough but fair to each and every lifter. There is no favoritism in the WNPF. Our spotters caught every lifter on every attempt and there was only one misload the entire weekend. We also held our Annual World Strongman Championships on Sunday and Matt Keller won this event again for the second time in a row. We held our annual WNPF banquet on Saturday with many awards given out to the top lifters of the year. A WNPF Hall of Fame was started and Annette Schneidmill was the first inductee. This hall of fame is for past WNPF superstars. The requirements are you must be out of the sport for five years and you must be a past WNPF record holder and champion and also a good sportsman. Other past lifters were also inducted but we will give out these awards later this year. Now on to the meet. We will not be able to talk about every WNPF lifter at the worlds because Mike Lambert will kill us for taking up too much space in this magazine. In the women’s division Lynnie Whidden won her weight class and set a new WNPF world bench press record. Koley Hokeborn set several WNPF full meet and single lift world records and her first WNPF world title. Koley is a top WNPF female lifter. She benched 205 pounds RAW in the 132 class. In the 148’s we were waiting for this battle with Musser and Vega. Musser got out to a big lead in the squat 340 to 255 and then she got an even bigger lead after the bench 190 to 130. She was now up by 145 pounds and going into the deadlift. Denise and Melissa tied in the deadlift with 350 pounds. Denise won another best lifter award and her first WNPF raw world title. A.T. won her first WNPF World title in the SHW open raw division. Bomberger won his second WNPF world title over Foltz in the youth division. Molinaro won his first title in the 132 junior division. Tony Dimura won his first title and set a few WNPF records also. Gary Hoxworth is still going strong with over 40 years experience. Gary set four world records and he also won the best lifter award in the deadlift only division. Rock, Catina, Alongi, Cinelli and Lombardo all won WNPF World titles in the 181 class. Ray Dennison and Tom Conway battled in the masters 55-59 division with Tom coming out ahead by 55 pounds. In the 198’s Terry Edwards won the lifetime equipped division over four competitors with a 1570 total. Joe Ruscitelli took the masters class and set a new world masters bench press record in the 198’s. Kadle won by five pounds over Mangine in the raw division. In the 220’s James Davis won his first WNPF title with a 1660 total and 500 bench. James is new to the sport with only one year of experience under his belt. He is very strong but he has a long way to go as far as learning how to powerlift. Imagine once he learn how to lift where his total will be. Wayne Kliefoth won the masters 198 and set several records. Chris Loomis and Ralph Brown won their classes in the 220 masters. Floyd Givens took the masters and police divisions even though he suffered an injury in the squat event. Bartos and Hammond lifted superbly in the teenage divisions with Bartos setting four new world records. Miller won in the raw class in the 242’s. John Perrotta won the 242’s over Joel Killen. Joel actually could have lifted in the masters but he chose to lift in the open for the competition. Jeff Bradley set a new World bench record in the masters 242 class. Mr. Reyes and Mr. Yawn won their first titles in the WNPF. Teddy T. was off in the deadlift and bench over wise he would have gave Mr. Yawn more of a battle. In the Bench only divisions all of the women set new world records except for Rosenthal. Ms. Rosenthal actually lifted in her first world meet and did very well. Now for the big boys, Diekel, Lewis, Claypatch and Cawley lifted well and most of them set records. Mr. Love did a RAW 360 in the 148’s. This guy is strong, very strong and he showed it with his first WNPF World title. Dessau won the submasters division and Morrison took the Masters over 50 class. Claypatch, Wooten and Charles V. won their classes in the 165’s. John is an amazing lifter, he has no legs on the lower part but he balances himself on the bench without any problems and pushes his benches up strong. Bob Legg, always dependable and consistent. Bob is one of those guys that just love the sport. He comes to the meet to have fun and to try and set personal records. We are happy to have Bob as a WNPF member. Little Bruce Swanson won the 181 teenage division. Fabozzi beat out Snouffer by 10 pounds. They battled until the last attempt. Ryan improved to 455 this year from 420 last year. Martin hit 420 raw in the 181 lifetime class and he also set a new record. Mann took first in the masters and second in the lifetime division. Bill Ross beat out John Kampo in the subs 181 raw division and Rudy Lozano came from CA. to take the masters 65-69 division. Jamie Matta won the lifetime division and Chruchman won the masters 60+ division. Burt Rosenfield won both the masters raw and equipped divisions in the 198 70+ division. We had a good battle in the 220 class raw and equipped divisions. John Feehan from Ireland won the masters and open divisions with a 510 bench. This was his opener and today this was all that he needed to win. As you can see the other five lifters were not very far apart with their lifts. Davis beat out Shaw in the raw class but Shaw won the open and subasters division in the 220’s. Mellinger had an off day but I’m sure he will come back stronger next year. Tiger Sr. (Republic of GA.) won the masters class and Roland Cote and Shales were very close in the master’s 55-59 divisions. Jimmy Brown won two divisions and his first WNPF title in the 242’s. Erb, Levine, Bidinotto and Stears won their classes. Bidinotto set two new world masters classes. In the 275 class, what a day. There were so many lifters that bombed or passed on lifts in this class including the SHW lifters. We sat there and watch uneven lockouts, seesawing, butts rising up and foot movement by many lifters. Three of these lifters finally got their third attempts Lewis, Cawley and Norris to stay in the meet. Memadov won the 275 raw division and set a new world and republic of Georgia record. In the deadlift Maria Ferguson showed out. She has to be in the top three deadlift in the women’s 123 class. She pulled 390 pounds and missed 410. Tracy Fitzpatrick won her first WNPF title and dedicated her meet to her dad who got in a car accident a few months earlier. Jim was also a WNPF lifter and he trained Tracy hard for this world meet and thanks to Joe Careri she continued her training for this meet. Zambelli, Howorth and Erb all set new WNPF records. Merebishvili won over Dan Myers in the junior 165 class. Space set a new WNPF record, Rijos Soto won the raw division and Jenkins took the masters 65-69 division with a lift of 500 pounds. Andy Skinner from Canada set several Canadian records as well as new WNPF World records. Tee Meyers put on his usual show with a 735 deadlift. Tee came up to New Jersey to judge, sell clothes and entertain. I thank Tee for all of his help this weekend. Caffrey won the lifetime raw division over two competitors, one from Canada and the other from the Republic of Georgia. Finland took the junior division 242. Jeff Anderson from N.J. won the masters 242 division. Big Cooper pulled 705 in the 242’s he’s good for 760-770 but not today. The giant Olaaje pulled 630. John is 6’8” tall. Jim Dusenbury from N.Y. set a new record and he’s always very complementary about the WNPF meets and staff. Terry O’Neill from England hit 640 pounds in the masters 45-49 class. Big Irv Brown set two new WNPF records in the SHW class. The Highlights in the World squat championship include the Russian Aladuari posted a 550 with a win over Caffrey and Nick Maltezos coming back after braking his arm last year squatted 685 and missed 700. In the powercurl worlds the Russians dominated. Brian Edwards won both the masters and open divisions and the best lifter award on day one. Mark Wilhelm took the title home in the 181’s over Massetti. This was a very close contest between Wilhelm and Massetti. In the 198 masters newcomer Carr defeated Dunn and Williams. Aludauri defeated USA Diciano and Canada’s Marshall in the 220’s. Both Tim and Mike Slagus put on excellent performances and they both set new world records. We want to give thanks to Tom Conway and Team Calvary for attending and doing so well. Also Team Ephrata for bringing a team and thanks to Barry Erb. Thanks to Lynnie Whidden and her team from Orlando. Thanks to team Hoxworth also. Lifters please keep in mind that the WNPF is here for you to have fun. Were not out to bash anyone, play favoritism or to get people upset to the point where a fight may start, violence and obscene language is used. We had an incident at the worlds where one lifter will no longer be allowed to participate in the WNPF and it’s ashamed that this had to happen but no one and I mean no one is bigger than the WNPF organization not the lifters, staff, officials or administrators. Anyone that thinks for a moment that this person was right for what he did then we don’t want you in the WNPF this includes the people that talk on the internet forums and the people that heard one side of the story and people that weren’t there. We are here to do the best job that we can in putting on these meets. We don’t make millions of dollars doing this and if you knew how much it cost to put on one of these meets I’m sure lifters would look at things a little different. We do it because we like to and we like making people happy and we want people to go home with good memories. If you get a red light try not to look at it like we don’t want you to get the lift. That is the last thing we want. We felt very bad that many lifters bombed on Sunday. If there were no rules and if this was an anything goes league I’m sure people would still find something to bash us about. We try to have the lifters do the lifts correct or as close to correct as possible at worlds. This is not to say that our officials are perfect because that they are not, they do make mistakes. Lifts look different depending on where you are seated or standing. Most of the people in the audience believe they can see the calls on the platform, trust me they can’t. Lifters think they can see everything from the warm-up room, trust me they can’t. I’ve said this before and I will say it again. I challenge any lifter, spectator or coach to sit down in the CHAIR with the switch and you will see the difference in the lifts on the platform. You will feel the pressure to make the correct call. Try it once please! I challenge you to sit down in the chair. The 2005 Worlds will be split up next year with the full meet in November in Ohio or Michigan and the single lift championships in Orlando, Florida or Atlanta some time in November or December. Make sure you qualify at a WNPF event in 2005. Until next year, stay strong, stay healthy and stay clean. (WNPF)",,,,,
