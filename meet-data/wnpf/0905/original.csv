"Great meet, great meet. The facility was a little tight but we made the best of it. Thanks to Lee Zimmerman for allowing us to use his facility in northern Philadelphia. Great performances by Bret Altimore, Tim Mclaughlin and Dave Yearnell. Pete Catina brought a team from Penn state college (York) and all of these kids did a fabulous job and I hope they continue in the sport. They will all increase their lifts under the direction of coach Pete. Thanks to Tim Sexton for bringing down his kids to compete also.",,,,,,,,,,

Thanks to B & R Fitness Club for bringing a few guys to the event. Thanks to the many spectators that came to support their favorite lifters and also thanks to the WNPF staff for putting on a great meet once again. (WNPF),,,,,,,,,,
