2012 WNPF Raw Worlds,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"World Raw Tournament of Champions - February 26, 2012. First place in the Open Squat and Best Lifter at the age of 40. Broke World and State records. This one was tough; missing the first two lifts and then making the third. Went down a weight class to enter the 220 class. The first time since the 1999 Nationals. ",,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"This was the 13th year I was lucky enough to win a WNPF World Title.  ""Lucky"" number 13 proved to be interesting. This was the toughest Worlds I've ever done. There was a moment when I thought I was doomed. I entered the 220 class (the first time in this weight class since the summer of 1999) weighing around 215. Then a week before the meet I was overweight. Having to suck down weight to make weight took away more strength than expected. I only went 1 for 3 but it was enough to win Best Lifter and grab a new World record! I've always said, when you get a lift in this league, it's a real lift.",,,,,,,,,,,,,

"The 2012 WNPF All-Raw Tournament of Champions was a BIG success. We had 112 lifters from 15 states and 2 countries attend this event. We also had a three equipped meets along with this championships. Thanks to all of the judges that did an outstanding job in all locations and thanks to all of the staff and helpers for making the meets a success. Thanks to all of the lifters that came out stepped on the platform and showed everyone what drug free lifting was all about. There were several lifters that bombed out due to rule technicalities, poor technique or just starting out to heavy. We hope that these lifters will regroup and come back to the next WNPF meet even stronger. The one thing that we hate to see is lifters that come to these meets and bomb, we want everyone to go 3 for 3 or 9 for 9 and go home happy with all world records. Brendan Didiano had an outstanding day with a 1355 total in the junior division. Greg Hartranft is the new SHW star in the WNPF, this kid is STRONG!!!!!! He will deadlift 800 either later this year or early next year RAW. Matt Smith is strong raw and equipped and hold many records in the WNPF. Geoff Roberts is another rising star in the WNPF with a 640 deadift. Leo Monroe curled more than anyone EVER in the WNPF with a 245 powercurl, many think the curl is a joke. Let me see you curl 245 pounds. Nick Maltezos moved up an age group and set another world record in the squat. Thomas Bayer and Ray Dennison posted impressive totals in the over 60 age group. Levan Giligashvili traveled all the way from the Republic of Georgia and benched a BIG 430 lbs in the 165 class. Dave Cooper, Josh Bush, John Leoanard and Doug Mignot also turned in some impressive totals in the tournament. I wish I could list everyone but the results are listed above. We hope to see all of you in the near future in the WNPF. Thanks to everyone again for supporting the WNPF family. (WNPF)",,,,,,,,,,,,,
