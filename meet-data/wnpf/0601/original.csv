"*- WNPF WORLD RECORD, TEAM CHAMPS (POWERLIFTING)- EPHRATA POWER TEAM, TEAM CHAMPS (BENCH PRESS) IRON RAIDERS, 2ND PLACE- EPHRATA. BL- BEST LIFTER.",,,,,
,,,,,
,,,,,
,,,,,
"The 15th annual WNPF World Powerlifting Championships took place in Atlantic City,NJ. In my 20 years of putting on meets this was one of the best meets that we’ve ever had. Just about everything went as planned. We ended up with 191 lifters from four countries. We had some of the best equipment on the platform and in the warm-up area. We used the monolift for squats, Forza bench for the bench press, Ivanko bar for the squat and bench and the okie deadlift bar for the deadlift. We put one monolift in the warm-up area and there were four warm-up stations for everyone to use. The venue was great with over 7,000 square feet of space and the Atlantic City casinos were 10 minutes away. The best spotters in the world did a fabulous job Steve, Kenny, John, Chris, Perry and Adrian were great and again they are the best, catching each and every lifter, encouraging all lifters and loading and unloading the weights quickly all three days. We finished at 3:30pm on Friday, 5pm on Saturday and 4pm on Sunday. Our judges did a good job calling the meet and there were some disputed calls and some inconsistency in the bench press and powercurl events I must admit. This is something that we will definitely work on for future WNPF meets but overall they did a good job. One thing we’ve learned is that we must have a judges briefing before each WNPF meet so the judges are all on the same page. A few lifters emailed me and said that the officials were too hard on them and I’m not going to dispute this but this was the world championships. WNPF officials are easy at state meets, a little harder at nationals and they step it up a notch at worlds. One guy said that the WNPF and USAPL are the strictest leagues out there right now. Many of our judges are from the old school and they judge lifters of today the way they were judged years ago but guess what powerlifting is different now. Things are not the same in powerlifting from the equipment to the officiating so we will try to adjust to the new way of things. One thing I don’t do is tell my officials to be overly strict and red light everything no matter what like someone mentioned. Don’t believe everything you read or hear because he just loves to stir up controversy and these are false statements. From this point on I will not respond to anything that this person says because it’s not important anymore and I’m just finished with the negative comments from this individual. Lifters thanks for informing me about these comments but I do not care to know what is being said on these forums from this point on. I always say that if people want to know something about the WNPF please contact me and I will tell you the truth I have no reason to lie or bash people like others do on forums. I have learned in life that some people will smile in your face and as soon as you turn sideways the knife is on its way and when you make a complete turn it’s in your back. I take full blame for any problems that we may have had at the meet which weren’t many at all. These guys made the meet out to be a disaster and it was far from that. Our judges want everyone to make their lifts they cheer for the lifters and try to help them by giving them tips and they try to explain why they received red lights. Some lifters understand and some just walk off and get angry. One thing the judges will do is give a lifter a lift before they take one away. Please lifters try and understand that these guys have a thankless job and they do make mistakes but lifters make mistakes also and you and your coaches cannot see most of the lifts from the coach’s box, warm-up room and from the audience. Also all of these judges are former and current lifters too so they do understand the lifters side also. There were many happy lifters at the meet and they came up to myself, Lester, Tee, Ron Deamicis and others and told us so. Onto a happy note Lester Fields is healthy again and did a great job announcing along with Glenda and Denise keeping score. Thanks to Zach Rhodes an active duty Marine who has served in Iraq a few times and Adrian Locklear at the door along with Moms and Steve selling t-shirt at the table. We will be in Atlanta,GA. in November, 2007 for the 16th WNPF World Championships. This will be the first time in 8 years the WNPF Worlds will be in Atlanta. So make your plans to be there. The awards were awesome with Neils Andersen Atlas Sculptures, Hercules in Chains, 4’ Swords and more. We held our annual banquet on Saturday night to honor the top WNPF lifters of the year. We also honored five new members to the WNPF Hall of Fame, John Wallace, Roy Maxwell, James Perry, Jim Sullivan and Jim Poinsett. All of the top lifts in the single ply division were new world records, single ply meaning single ply shirts that are closed in the back and lifters that squat with just a suit on and no briefs. More than half of the lifters in the meet were raw. I never thought I would see the day when the majority of the lifters would be lifting raw. We ended up with 15 women total and they all did great with no one bombing out. Janelle in the youth 11-12 division lifting in her first world meet set four new world records in her class. Diana Roscoe also lifting in her first world meet and only her third power meet did very well in the 132 class. Maria Spano set new world master records in the 50-54 division and she deadlifted 363 pounds and she won best lifter in the deadlift. Jennifer Slagus set new records also and she also hit the 300 pound mark in the deadlift. This is a great feat for an eleven year old girl. She has reached celebrity status in her hometown getting interviews from both the newspaper and television people in her area. Denise Musser battling injuries almost totaled 800 lbs. in the raw division weighing 149 pounds; she was near 900 pounds a few years ago. Olan and Cohn lifted well in the SHW divisions. Rich Ullman returned to the WNPF this year in the open division. I remembered when he lifted in the teenage division almost 10 years ago. Big Nate Litowsky did well in the youth division. This kid is improving year after year and his dad Benny does a good job with him at every meet. Vernon defeated Foltz in the 132 lb. teenage division by almost 90 pounds. Brink won his first world title in the 148 class. Andre Ferreira set new records and also won his first title in the 148 lifetime raw division. Paul Zingone from Brooklyn defeated last years champ Lance Klaassen in the 165 teenage division and they both lifted well. Joe Rosato was on! He set new records in the 165 lifetime raw class and former IPF world champ Gary Hoxworth won the 55-59 raw division. Ciaccia, Ellis and Shultz battled in the 181 teenage raw division with Ciaccia winning the class and setting a new world deadlift record. Tony Williams from New Mexico and Pete Catina both won the masters divisions in the 181 class. Both of these lifters lifted in the first WNPF Worlds back in 1992 in Lancaster,Pa. Greg Wright from Florida took home his third WNPF title and another best lifter award. Tee Meyers was calling him an old man when he came up to the platform and Greg showed him how old he is with a 573 pound deadlift. Don Levesque won the masters 70-74 division and set all new World records. Luis Perez and Mike Mcninch won the submasters and submasters raw divisions in the 198 class. Luis made his comeback after taking 11 years off. This was his third meet back this year and he has improved so much since July. Vic Scaranda won the 55-59 198 class and Jon Rock won his first WNPF equipped title. Jon would have totaled more but he missed a 600+ pound squat, jumping from 407 to over 600 pounds. Dan “Da Man” Caffrey won the lifetime raw division over Canadian Scott Marshall. Dave Polis suffered an injury and had to take a token deadlift in the 220 master’s class. Both Bill Schemel and John Phillips took home a WNPF world title in the 220 masters classes. Dan Lobue hit a 600 squat and a 1500 lb. raw total in the junior division. Ed Debari won three titles in the 242 raw divisions. Mike Vernon lifted well and was looking forward to meeting and getting some tips from Jeff Diegan at worlds. Jeff is the best 242 lb. raw lifter in the WNPF but he did not attend this years championships. Big Dave Cooper won the lifetime 242 class with a 1700+ total and Jeff Fambrough won the junior raw division and made all of his squats look so easy. Jason Wood from Arizona is built like a tank with huge thighs and calves. I told him before the meet to go for the big 800 pound squat and don’t worry my spotters will be there for him. He hit an easy 733 then an easy 771 and then 804 was next. He came out ready and walked up to the bar and set up, went down and was on his way up and he dropped his head and the lift was over. He knew what he did after and was upset with himself. Jason will squat 800+ in the very near future in the WNPF. Jason will also be the new WNPF Arizona state chairman and put on a meet or two in 2007. Ostrom from Michigan and Brad Lovejoy won their classes in the 275 master’s divisons. Rich Luklan totaled over 1650 in the masters 300 class. Big Matt Wanat all 6’6”, 300+ pounds defeated Jmukhadza from the Republic of Ga. In the SHW raw division and Marlin “Eclipse” Nelson took home his first WNPF title and he improved so much from the Pan-Am Championships in Orlando in May, now onto the World Bench Press Championships. Bonnie Benner won the 123 open and masters divisions and also took home the best lifter award with a 165 lb. bench press. Bonnie is just coming back after a 10 month layoff due to her son battling cancer in the hospital. Last year she benched 190 raw and now she’s up to 165 pounds with a shirt on. I think she is a better raw lifter than shirted lifter. Jill Daivsh, Adrianne Fink and Tompkins from Indiana won their first world titles in the WNPF. Tim McDowell won the 123 junior division, Josh Melton in his second meet won his class. Steve Smith, not the Carolina Panther wide receiver but the famous Steve Smith won the 132 70-74 class with a 165 pound bench. Sinath Sam from Delaware came back in 2006 after a 4-5 year layoff won both the open and submasters division with a 270 lb. world record bench. Wayne Claypatch set a new record and won his class in the 148 lb. division and Tom Duff won the 55-59 division. Cody Bartlett defeated John Ferris in the 65-69 148 class with a 237 lb. bench. In the 165 lifetime division we had a battle going on with Ralph Lara, Joe Rosato and Beau Greer. We were hoping Jason Burns would have made it but he had some personal problems and couldn’t attend. Jason the WNPF will be waiting for you when you return. Ralph took home the gold with a 369 bench. Joe Rosato and former WNPF world champ Beau Greer tied at 347 with Joe winning on bodyweight. Chuck Venturella defeated Carlos Artur from Brazil in the open 165 class. Bill Ross won the 181 lifetime and subs divisions with a 457 bench. Allan Passman won the masters raw division and first timer Chris Johnson from Canada won the masters equipped division. Stan Freed and Chris Livolsi won their classes and they both set new world records. McDowell won the juniors and Mike McCoy won the lifetime division and best lifter. Mike took a few years off also and came back in July to qualify for worlds. Mike Bachmayer won the masters and police divisions with a 374 bench. Leo Ryan came to bench over 500 pounds and he had trouble setting up and just couldn’t get it together. Then on his last attempt with 468 we adjusted the rack for him and he rammed up 468 so easy. Leo will be back in 2007 and he will bench 500+ in the 198’s. Troy Lehrer won both the open and lifetime divisions with a 512 bench. He went up to 556 and missed it but he came very close to getting it. Phil Darbouze set a world record in the masters as well as N.J. state chairman Glen Haley. Glen needs some time off, he did so many meets this year and it showed. He still locked out 435 pounds in the bench for a new world record. Lhota, Glenney, Mitchell and Davis all won their classes in the master’s divisons. Jake Haybeidan from PA. hit a 380 new world record in the teen division. I heard this was his last WNPF meet, good luck Jake wherever you decide to lift. Kelly Fasnacht won his first title with a 441 bench. Nick Maltezos one of the old WNPF veterans won two classes in the bench. Bill Bidinotto made one attempt to stay in the meet in the over 60 class. Bryan Hoffman from Indiana started out in the high 400’s and missed all three attempts. He locked out his left arm but couldn’t lock out his right arm due to an injury. I spoke with him after and just told him not to lock out either arm so both arms can come up evenly and this would look a lot better than his lopsided lockout. We have two lifters, Larry Davis and Pete Catina that can’t lock out either arm and we just told them to go as high as possible with their lockouts and we will count their lifts. Hopefully Brian will come back in 07 and get a lift in and become a champion. The oldest competitor in the meet Ray Romero hit 209 at 77 yrs. of age. Ray is an ex-Philadelphia Eagle football player. In the 300’s and Supers we had several lifters that were attempting big, big lifts. Buddy Cawley hit 518 in the raw division and 677 in the unlimited division; Buddy won both best lifter awards in the raw and equipped divisions. Jeff Peshek tried an all time high 804 lb. bench but missed it twice, he stated that he just didn’t have it today. He promised me that in 07 at worlds he will hit 804 or more. Andy Shaffer from PA. benched 600 raw at the PA. states and was hoping to set an all time high raw bench at the world championships. He tried 611 three times and could not lock out the weight at the top. Now onto the World Deadlift Championships, Adam Debonis was so happy to be at his first world championships and he showed out with a 407 lb. deadlift and world record. Carlos Artur from Brazil made a 584 deadlift raw in the 165 class and won best lifter. Bob Legg set a world record in the police division and John Badurek won both the open and submasters divisions. Darren Nemow could compete in two sports powerlifting and bodybuilding, this guy is put together. He deadlifted 622 lbs. in the 181 lifetime open division. Dick Jenkins and Don Levesque both 70+ years of age battled with Dick coming out ahead with a 441 deadlift. Dick would like to be the first 70+ yr. old to deadlift 500 pounds in the WNPF. Speaking of old lifters, Tee “Skinnyman” Meyers couldn’t wait to hit the platform. He just turned 50 yrs. old and he wanted to hit an all time high for a 50 yr. old in the 198 class and guess what he did it. He hit a 733 deadlift and made history becoming the all time highest deadlifter in the 198’s in the 50-59 age group. This was the most weight lifted ever in powerlifting history in this class, Tee said to look it up if you don’t believe him. I must mentioned because one person said that Tee is a deadlifter judging the bench press and his press signal was too long on Friday. Tee was also a full meet lifter years ago and he sustained an injury and he has trouble doing full meets now. He has totaled over 1,800 in the 198 class so he is more than qualified to judge any lift. He did not give a quick press signal on Friday because the bar was still moving on some of the lifters chest and he waited until the bar stopped to give the signal. I’ll tell you many of you missed a show on Saturday with flight three of the deadlifts. These guys SHOWED OUT! Meyers with 733, Sadiv with 650, Casagrande with 722, Chet Slaybaugh with 650, Lopez with 622 and Nemow with 622. Charles Slaybaugh lifted 633 in the 242’s and Chet,Charles said he is the good looking twin brother not you. Mike Spahr set another world record and Teddy Finland hit a 606 and is good for more but he injured himself on one of his attempts. Big Dean Nichols hit 683 and hurt his back in an attempt to hit over 700 pounds. Dean and Tee went at it in Atlanta in July, they both hit of 730+ and went back in forth talking junk until Dean lifted more than Tee and became the crowd favorite. Tee has a knack for getting lifters to push themselves to the end. He will get in their face and talk so much mess that these guys will push themselves pass their limits and then they realize that Tee is a gre
t guy once they get to know him and not the loud mouth that people think he is. Onto the Powercurl Worlds Javakhishvili from the Republic of Georgia curled 136 pounds in the 132 class. Ralph Lara curled 174 pounds in the 165 class and set another world record. Mark Wilhelm set another World record and took home another best lifter award. Andy Skinner from Canada came up to me before the meet and was just hoping to place to receive one of the smaller Atlas awards. I told him that you never know what will happen you may place first and guess what he did? He placed first in both the open and masters divisions. There was a three way tie in the 198’s with Skinner placing first, Bettini placing second and Mcdowell placing third. Doc Hashamiyoon started too high and did not make a lift in the curl and he was the favorite to win. Mike Slagus hit a 180 and then a WR 185 in the masters 40-49 division. We had four guys curl over 200 pounds, Ellinger 215, Monroe 240, Ocampo 231 and Jmukhadze 226. Onto the World Squat Championships, Carlos Artur from Brazil hit a 507 raw squat in the 165’s. Mike Mcninch set a new WR at 512 in the 198’s raw. Mike Kenney hit 573 in the 220 class for a new WR. Nick Maltezos set records in both the open and lifetime divisions with a 600 raw squat. Jim Edgerton hit a 496 raw squat in the 242 masters class and Jason Wood hit 771 in the 275 class. Onto the World Ironmaiden/Ironman Championships. Former top USAPL women’s lifter Jackie Manzo lifted in the 123 class and set records in both the bench and deadlift. Stephanie Rivers did an outstanding job for only her second meet. Crawford and Askins both lifted well in the Ironman division. Eric Winter bombed out in the squat but he came on strong in the bench and deadlift to win his class and the best lifter award in the Ironman. Crawford and Corliss our two special Olympian lifters lifted well and both of these gentlemen set new world records also. I want to thank everyone that supported the WNPF Worlds this year. We appreciate you! We are in the business to put on quality meets and to make sure you have fun, although we didn’t accomplish that with everyone we hope to do so in the near future. Before you listen to people bashing us and talking about us please come and check us out and then judge us for yourself. Again were not perfect and never claim to be and no lifter or federation is either so please be smart and say to yourself there must be another side to this. Were going to try our best to improve on our mistakes and make things better for all of us. Everyone enjoy your holidays, put your family first and stay healthy and we hope to see you next year. Also thanks to Powerlifting USA and Mike Lambert for supporting us. (WNPF)",,,,,
