"Overall the 17th WNPF World Championship meet was a success. Many state, national and world records were broken and congratulations to these lifters for their success. There were many great lifts such as Jason Wood 900 squat, Ken Millrany 630 single ply bench, Edgar Masters from Guatemala 480 single ply bench, Leo Monroe 220 pound curl, Carlos Artur 585 raw deadlift, Charlie Paige 385 raw bench, Greg Wright 615 deadlift, Wade Johnson 720 raw squat, Mike Francis 820 single ply squat, Mark Driggers, Matt Sartain and Juan Collazo overall totals, Koley Hockeborn 215 bench and Denise Musser 190 bench. We hit a few bumps in the road and will certainly learn from them and be ready for the 18th World Championship event in New Jersey and WNPF LIFETIME Worlds in Orlando, Fl. I take full blame for the little mishaps that happened at the event which weren’t many, such as not using our kilos for this meet and some of the judging was not up to the usual WNPF standards. There were a few lifters that said they weren’t used to that style of judging in the WNPF. We made some adjustments on Sunday and everything was better and I guarantee it won’t happen again. Again I take full blame for our small problems. We finished Saturday’s event at 4:30 and did our 2008 lifter of the year awards ceremony and our Hall of Fame inductee’s presentation. Congratulations to Perry Thomas and Natasha Newbold.  On Sunday we finished at 3pm. Our spotters were fabulous! They caught everyone and I know the lifters felt safe with these guys around them. As usual Lester Fields my MC and friend did a wonderful job with the help of the best scorekeepers in the business Glenda and Cindy. I must thank everyone on staff for helping at this meet. Tom Isbell, Ron Deamicis, Dina Digrazia, Susie Thompson, Greg Campbell, Brian Burritt, a couple of guys from Willy’s Powerhouse, Jamie Cooper, Adrian Locklear, Cetra and Latoya, Ray France, Troy Martin, Steve Yeargin, Perry Thomas and whomever else I may have missed. Speaking of missed we greatly missed the Skinny Man Tee Meyers at this world meet, also Big Dean Nichols and Buddy Cawley. These guys should be back in 2009. We tested 12 lifters and all lifters passed our drug test. Speaking of drug test lifters keep in mind that the WNPF does not ban lifters if they appeal our test and prove to us that they were indeed clean in the past and that is what happened with one lifter. Also you may be a WNPF member for one year or ten years but we will test you if you are one of the top lifters in our league or if we feel there is a need to test you. No one gets a pass when it comes to testing. We had over 100 lifters from 18 states and four countries attend. I want to thank the lifters that came from so far away. Lifters came from England, Brazil, Guatemala and the USA. We expect the number of countries to double in 2009. We did hang up the Georgia Republic flag in honor of our good friends from Georgia. They would have attended this event but due to a war in their country they could not. We hope to see them in 2009. Again, thanks to all of the lifters, spectators, staff members and to Sherman Ledford from Quest Nutrition for attending our annual event. Also I want to welcome our newest country into the WNPF family the WNPF Guatemala Powerlifting Federation.  (WNPF)",,,,,
