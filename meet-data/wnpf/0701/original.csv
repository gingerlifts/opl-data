"*- WNPF World record, BL- Best lifter, Team Champs- Iron Raiders Power Team",,,,,
,,,,,
What a meet! This was the first time the WNPF had an all raw contest and we had a lot of fun. I really see the difference,,,,,
,,,,,
"in the raw meets compared to the equipped meets. You don’t have the problems with the uneven lockouts, seesawing in",,,,,
,,,,,
the bench press and other technicalities. I truly understand why the ADAU and 100% Raw leagues only offer raw divisions.,,,,,
,,,,,
In the WNPF we allow wraps and this is for safety reasons and a lot of the older lifters need that extra protection. Many people,,,,,
,,,,,
say that were not truly raw because of this but we will continue to allow wraps in the WNPF. To my surprise many lifters,,,,,
,,,,,
"did not use knee or wrist wraps and that was very impressive considering the weights these guys moved at this event. A few lifters that showed out were Javakhishvili from Georgia with a 331 bench at 132, Dennis Cieri who benched an amazing 529 lbs., Tim Lyons squatted 694 and just missed a 700+ deadlift, Richard Ambrose 650 deadlift, Brian Brouwer from Canada with a 661 deadlft in the junior division, Brian Lang with a 556 squat in the teenage division and what a battle in the 165 junior division with Lew Spirtos and Sean Turzanski, Sean won the rep contest and Lew took home the gold with a 352 bench. We ended up with 61 lifters from 3 countries (USA, Canada and Republic of Georgia). We started the meet at 10:24 and finished with awards and all at 4:27. Again, I can’t thank my fine staff for all of the hard work that they put in. If it weren’t for them these meets would not be as good as they are. My officials were Jim Poinsett, Bob DeRisi, Jule Dolci, Annette Schneidmill and Wayne Keifer judges and spotted. The spotters were Robert Caresco, Dan Lobue, Roger Wanner & Perry Thomas. Denise Musser and Glenda Klaassen kept score and Lester Fields was the M.C. with moms and Steven at the door. We had over 150 Spectators at this event and they were loud. Thanks to MHP, Troy Lehrer and Joe Mazza for their sponsorship and Mike Lambert of Powerlifting USA for his sponsorship. We will continue to have this event in February but in 2008 we will move it to Atlantic City, NJ. Thanks to all of the lifters that came out and took the challenge to take off the equipment and show people what real strength athletes can do. Until next time, take care and we hope to see everyone at another WNPF meet. (WNPF)",,,,,
