"Another WNPF Worlds in the books for us once again. What a great meet this was, the talent was exceptional along with the best facility many lifters have ever seen. Oceanside Gym in EHT, NJ just right outside Atlantic City is no doubt the best gym for all of your needs. They give everyone what they need in a facility from cardio to strongman to powerlifting to Olympic lifting to training for the combine and more. If any of you are looking for a place to train don’t forget Oceanside Gym. Phil the owner was a great host along with his staff and we will be back in 2010 for a few meets. The lifters had 5-6 platforms to warm up on and plenty of weight for everyone to use. The weather wasn’t great where it rained most of the time but the lifters and the spectators came out in full force. We estimated that we had at least 400 spectators at the meet and everyone was let in free of charge. Thanks to Bill Ross for all of his help in landing this facility for us and for bringing in tables and chairs. We had some great lifters at this event with some great numbers. Some of the guys started a little too high and didn’t make their lifts but I’m sure they will be more encouraged to bounce back at the next WNPF meet. Karen Poyner from VA.had a great day setting five new WNPF World records in the 105 class and taking home the women’s best lifter award. Kristine Longshore set a WNPF total record in the 114 pound class. The youngster Anna McCloskey set three new world records and had the highest deadlift of the meet with a very impressive 424 lb. lift. Jean Stubbings set a new powercurl record in the masters division and Christine Leedom won the masters 165 class. Ray Cortes III defeated Everett Faschnat in the bench by 10 lbs and taking home the gold and setting two world records in the bench and powerucrl. Edison Flores came out smoking with six new world records in the 132 13-16 division. Sinath Sam from Delaware set two new powercurl records in the 132 class. Bob Legg set two new world records and won five divisions in the 148’s. Brandon Yeager won his first WNPF World title. In the 165’s Hans Deppenschmidt broke three world records and won the open raw division. The oldest competitor Juan Collazo from NY set four new records and won the award for the loudest applause of the meet. Lance Klaassen won the junior division and this was the first time Lance competed with gear on in a WNPF world championships. When Lance gets accustom to using equipment his lifts will go up dramatically. Anthony Cantagallo from NJ won the 165 raw division and the lightweight best lifter award. Connor Dantzler from MD. Won both the deadlift and powercurl divisions. Pierre Harris didn’t have a good day, missing all three of his lifts, we look for him to bounce back strong. Dean Femera won his first world title in the teenage division. Dan Lombreglia one of the nicest guys in the WNPF took home his first title and the best lifter award for the raw lightweight powerlifters. Brent Smith took second to him in only his second power meet. Tom Conway lifting in the over 60 category set four new records, Tom has a few injuries that he is nursing but overall he did well. Brig Seaver won the masters category in the deadlift. Steve Pagano set a new single lift squat world record and Steve Vogel also set a world record bench. Dave Breakfield another nice gentleman from NJ did well in the master’s 50-59 raw bench. Doc Hash defeated Carl Machamer in the open raw division for his first title. Doc lifted in only his second full meet ever and did well and Carl did win the junior raw division. Chris Zerphey won the teenage best lifter award and won his first title over Eric Juergensen. David Kilhefner won his first WNPF title in the equipped division. Tony Williams from Puerto Rico won the masters 50-59 division with some impressive lifting. Tony has been with the WNPF since the first world championship back in 1992. Pat Carr won the masters powercurl event and placed second to Doc in the open. Dave Yarnell from PA. set a new world record in the deadlift over Gerry Peak. Gerry won the bench over Dave to win his first world title. Phil Rosenstern from PA. hit a 600 lb. deadlift not only to set a record but he also won the overall and masters best lifter awards. John Znaczko placed second behind Phil. John is also another WNPF lifter that has been around forever supporting the organization. Bill Ross had an off day missing all three of his attempts in the bench. Bill is one of the top WNPF benchers in the WNPF and we will see him bounce back in December at the Sarge McCray meet. John Diff won his first WNPF title in the equipped division. Lou Eleuteri another WNPF dinosaur form 1992 beat the two youngsters (Wes and Dan) in the open raw deadlift with an impressive 584 and he is over 50 years old. Wes defeated Dan in the squat only event for his first title. Phil Miller another one of the WNPF favorites beat out Wes and Dan in the open division and he also set a record in the bench press for the master’s class. Sai Parra a part of the Penn state power team from York won his first title. Dave Campbell from NY and Larry Davis from DE both master lifters won their classes also. Dave set a record in the rep contest with 24 reps. John Bosley defeated Fred Vogel in the master’s powercurl with a 163 pound curl. John Feehan from England won five divisions. John came all the way from England with a busted elbow and this prevented him from going all out in any of the events. John has been with the WNPF for 10 years now and we are glad to say that he is one of our closest and best friends in the league. When john heals up he will be in the 400 lb range in the raw division and over 500 in the equipped division. He is coming to Kissimmee for the WNPF Lifetime Worlds in November. Brian Burritt from FL. hit 496 pounds to win two classes in the 220 lb. weight class. Tommy Leana from Penn state defeated Matt Halderman for the first time in the junior raw division. What a class we had in the 242 open raw division. Big Dave Cooper, all 6’5”, 241 pounds came out and just demolished the rest of the field. Everyone was pretty close after the squats. Then Dave and Bob Merkh pulled away in the bench and then Dave took over in the deadlift. Dave hit 694, 722 and then 749. We had a vendor there selling coffee products with natural herbs in it. This coffee is the best coffee ever and I don’t drink coffee often, Dave is not a coffee drinker either but guess what he gave the credit to this coffee for getting a boost of adrenaline. Dave has never gotten all three of his deadlift attempts in the WNPF especially after squatting and benching. If anyone is interested in these products feel free to look up www.wnpf@organogold.com and they have many products from coffee to tea and supplements that can help you and your family members with joint problems and other ailments. Jason Wood our WNPF strongman for the day is also on these products and he loves what they have done for him in his powerlifting career. Getting back to the 242 class, Bob Merkh set a WNPF world record in the bench. With Brian Reed coming in third with a 611 pull. Andrew Furman looked impressive coming in fourth. Evan Snydman took fifth place and Bill Forrai came in sixth place. Carl Donati from PA. set new world records and took home two big awards for his efforts. Dave West got injured just before the meet and had to take token squats and deadlifts. Ed Killich won his first WNPF title and he also set a record in the single lift squat. John Howard set a new record in the rep contest with a total of 28 reps with 225 pounds. Frank Albert hit a 413 world record bench for his first title with a win over another long time member Jeff Hicks. Mark Coty set a new WNPF world record in the masters raw deadlift and Bill Voelkel won his class also. Josh Griffith won the junior division and Jesse Blanco from PA. won his first world title lifting only in a handful of full meets. Jesse started out as a bencher, then moved onto deadlifts and now does all three and he improves in each and every meet. He will be totaling over 1600 before we know it. Steve Adzima took home the police/fire/military title in the 275 class. Richard Ambrose totaled 1730 in the raw division with two world records in the squat and total. Josh Bush had to withdraw from the meet when he had an accident in the squat and injured his groin area. Josh will be back stronger and more determined than ever because that’s the type of competitor he is. Jason Wood the strongest man in the WNPF opened up with 865 in the squat and missed on depth, then came back and hit 865 easy and jumped to 909 lbs. with another easy effort. He then went on to bench 622 lbs and deadlift 644 for a total of 2175. Jason and Jeff Peshek were trying to be the first to hit a 2200 pound total in the WNPF, neither made it but one of them or both will in the very near future. Jason tried for the total on his last deadlift but couldn’t hold onto the bar and it slipped from his hand and he had to settle for 2175 which is still very IMPRESSIVE. This is the all time highest total in the WNPF. Brian Brammer set all new world records and was also battling a shoulder injury throughout the competition. Bill Hawk hit his opener of 501 and missed 600 on two other tries. Mark Pullyblank won his class and set a couple of records in the meantime also. John El Lineah Dey won his first title set some records and a best lifter award. Rich Plummer from Vegas also won his class in the masters over 60 division. Dave Chiavacci from NJ set a new world record in the deadlift with 611 pounds. Steve Grossman from NYC won the powercurl division and Michael Churchman from FL. couldn’t hit his benches. He said he didn’t feel good in his warm ups and should have dropped his opener. He is another guy that will bounce back in Florida for sure. THE TANK Tim McLaughlin will be the first to squat 800 pounds raw in the WNPF. Tim hit 771 so easy he easily had another 10-15 pounds in him on this day. He went on to total over 1900 lbs raw in the supers, I believe this is the highest raw total in the WNPF. Chane Cline set numerous records in the SHW class and what a nice guy. Eric Halvorsen another nice guy from NJ came in second to Chane. Jeff Peshek hit over 2000 lbs but missed some big attempts in the squat (870) and bench (733 & 760) which would have given him a total close to 2200. I can’t wait to see Jeff hit the numbers that I know he can hit at a WNPF World event. Andrew Nye set to world records and Bill Katinowsky defeated Zurab from Georgia in the bench. Zurab did set a world record in the bench press with a 331. Vernon McDaniel from MD. also won his division. And the man with the widest shoulders in the WNPF Brian Stock set a world record squat in the masters with a 606 raw squat. I want to thank Oceanside Gym once again for letting us have this meet in their facility. I want to thank my staff; Troy, Spencer, Dee, Chris, Leo, Adrian, Bob, Jule, Annette, Ron, Moms, Barbara, Gail, Kim, Glenda and Lester for the fine job they all did. We decided to make this a one day event and it was a long one. 103 lifters attended with one platform and we finished with awards at 7:45pm. We learned that even though this meet was a success we will make it a two day event if were running the full power guys along with the specialist again. Thanks to the many spectators that came out to cheer for their favorites. Thanks to my judges that did a fabulous job of calling the meet. They were strict and made every lift count. They said this is the worlds and this was the time for all lifters to step up and earn those world records and they did. These lifters in the WNPF can lift anywhere, trust me, ANYWHERE and get their lifts passed. Thanks to my spotters who didn’t have one misload and caught every lifter. Thanks to my computer, scorekeeper and announcer that did wonderful jobs. Thanks to my t-shirt sales people for doing great also. We cannot have the WNPF without the lifters, staff and spectators and the support of sponsors such as Powerlifting USA and Mike Lambert, Alan Thomas and APT Wraps. They make the best wraps in the world and watch out for their bench shirts. Thanks to Ken Andersen from Titan for coming out. This was the first time I met Ken and he is a great guy and I hope my equipped lifters support him. Thanks to Eric and Dave from Organogold, they have a great product and as soon as other lifters get some information on this product they will benefit from it too like Jason wood and Dave Cooper. Thanks to my lifters from overseas that attended. Also my guys from Guatemala  didn’t make it because of a car accident in Guatemala but we will see all of them in Kissimmee. I must mention the Penn State Power Team and their coach Pete Catina. Pete put this team together and what a nice group of kids they are. Pete should be proud of them and what a good job Pete has done in training these kids. I tried to mention each and everyone if I did not mention you please don’t take it personal but I thank you also. (WNPF)",,,,,,,,,,,,
