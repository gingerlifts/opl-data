From a NASA lifter:

"Retro classifies as just a belt and nothing else. No sleeves or wrist wraps. In NASA unequipped powerlifting qualifies both wraps and sleeves and there's no way to discern between wraps or sleeves for each lifter. Equipped lifting in NASA is strictly single ply."

From Tad Peters of NASA:

Unequipped Powerlifting in NASA refers to the use of a belt, singlet, kneewraps or sleeves and wristwraps. You cannot use a benchshirt, squat suit or briefs in that division at in our federation.
You will notice the columns on the meet results say Power, PPU, Unequip, etc. Unequip means unequipped powerlifting. Anything equipped is equipped. PP U is unequipped push pull, etc. That's how you know who was entered in what and what they totaled. As far as keeping track of what every individual lifter had on that day, we don't do that.
As long as they were wearing unequipped ruleset, they were unequipped. Could have been kneewraps or kneesleeves.
