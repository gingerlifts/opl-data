Powerlifting veterans Jyrki Varvas, Klaus Renfors and Jussi Mattila organized a deadlift-only meet in Turku, Finland.
The rules of the currently inactive RawPower federation were used in the meet, which meant all the lifts were done with a stiff power bar and the lifters were weighed in on the same day.
No weight classes. The Wilks formula was used to place the lifters.
