    # The min for age categories is set to 1 lower than expected
    # because the federation uses birth years but during 
    # its season, which runs from September 1 to August 31
    # (see https://www.ffforce.fr/categories-dage/).
    # So, for instance, a lifter born in 1980 and competing in 
    # November 2019 would be in the Masters 1 division (1980 to 1971). 
    # But if the min were set at 39.5, the checker would
    # consider that lifter too young for that division,
    # based on birth year.
