Full Power
"This annual event hosted by Adirondack Barbell is perhaps the best full power meet in the area. The proceeds help to support a good cause, which is Mark Rexroad's daughter Nova."
"As always, the judging was impeccable and the lifters were strong."
    Several people stepped up to help the spotting and loading. There certainly is never a lack of comraderie and support at any Metal Militia gathering. Good people supporting a good cause.
"Skullptures by Seeker brought out an amazing sampling of sculptured trophies, along with best lifter swords and battle axes. "
"Sarah Young stepped up to the platform in her first full power meet, with a total of 610 at 128 lbs bodyweight. Steve Smith put on an impressive show with a 1920 total in the 242 class. Billy Mimnaugh of Southside Gym impressed the crowd with his 2120 total at a svelt 271 lbs. The ever impressive John Bott buried an incredible 900 lb squat, and still completed the meet with a torn bicep. We certainly wish John the best."
"There was plenty of action in the bench segment of the meet. Little Evil kicked things off with a 65 lb bench at 52 lbs. She ended her day with a 75 lb bench. Her sister the Deadlift Wench followed her, breaking the 100 barrier with a 105 bench at 94 lbs bodyweight in only her second bench meet. There was a pretty big turnout in the teen divisions."
"There were some very impressive lightweight benches, as well as the middleweights, with Tom Young finally breaking the 500 barrier. Carl Perkins benched 600 at 238. In the Masters divisions, Sam Luciano benched a strong 400, and Scott Shales 415, both in the 220 classes. Buster Godden benched 525 in the 308 class at 51 yrs of age."
"The meet certainly was successful. Bill raised some money for a wonderful cause, and some really cool people hooked up on a really cool day in Glens Falls, NY."
It was a long day with some great lifts. This is an annual event that shouldn't be missed.
