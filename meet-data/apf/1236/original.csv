"APF New York State Championships – March 24, 2012",,,,,,,
"APF New York State chairman Shawna Mendelson and team Blue Collar Barbell hosted the APF New York State Championships on March 24th 2012. The meet was held at All Natural Gym in Lindenhurst, NY and Mc’d by APF New Hampshire State Chairman Dave Follansbee. There were a total of 40 lifters, making this event one of the biggest powerlifting meets Long Island New York has seen in over 5 years. Most of the lifters competed in the full meet, with a significant number in the Raw division.",,,,,,,

"The biggest stand-outs of this contest were not only the awesome lifts accomplished and how many new lifters attended, but the quality the meet, and how well it was run. Strict rules, consistent judging, and a continual flow to the contest were the order of the day.  Blue Collar Barbell worked as well oiled machine, and is looking forward to promoting even bigger future meets that will help further grow for the sport on Long Island!",,,,,,,
