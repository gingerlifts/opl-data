Iron Asylum Gym is proud to offer our lifters their original 8x10 meet photos! Sarah always works her ass off at the meets trying to capture all of your lifts and now she is making
"them available to you for only $5 each, by simply using the paypal button below."
"When you go into your page, click on the pic that you would like a copy of. The name of the pic will be in your address bar, it will be a name and number like johndoe2.jpg"
Put the name of your pic/pics in the comment section of your paypal payment. Sarah will ship them off to you asap.
