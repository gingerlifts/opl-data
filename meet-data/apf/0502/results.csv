Bench

I'd like to thank everyone who helped make the CandyAzz Classic the success that it is. Through the years I have made some pretty solid friends and have had some pretty great people in my corner. I appreciate you all.

"Zane, thanks for being there for your family. We appreciate everything you do, and I know that ""Whatever it Takes"", you'll be in it for the long haul. My little asses, Sarah and Kerri...not only did they lift some great prs in this meet, but they did all they could to help out along the way. I have a great family."

"Carl, thanks for all you do for me, in and out of the meets. Typing this brings a tear to my eye thinking how much you mean to me, and how I could never put it into words. You and Tina are the best. I love that you are a part of our lives. Skullptures by Seeker is the best in the business. I just keep watching you get bigger and bigger. It's great."

"Jay and Kyle. Thanks for all your help supporting the meet, and all your help during. I'm so glad that I popped my head on to the Fortified Iron forum to say hi, and ended up with some fantastic extended family."

Big thanks to John Inzer of Inzer Advance Designs. Thanks for your support to us and thanks for the best gear in the business. Special thanks to Judy. I appreciate your extra effort.

"House of Pain is always there for us. Rick is a man of integrity and HOP has the best in hardcore apparel, gear and accessories. "

Big thanks to Metal Militia and Underground Strength Magazine for coming out to support the meet. You guys are the best there is. It is always great to spend time with you.

Big thanks to EC from Infamous Graphics. He and his team helped come up with a great meet shirt and some awesome banners to hang at the venue. Their work totally kicks ass. 

"Also a big thanks to 21st Century Fitness, A&A Improvements, Culligan of the Mohawk Valley, Fit Happens, Fratianni Auction Gallery, Garry L. Outtrim, Hilltop Collision, HogEye Auctions, Mancini Motors, Market Street Pizza, Nethaway Motorcar Co., Perry's Pools, Primavera Limousine Service, Pure Power Magazine, Total Image Health Club and Vintage Manor Antiques. It's great to have such huge support from our local sponsors. "

"Last and certainly not least, thanks to all who turned out to lift, work and support. Had a great time and hope to see you all again."
