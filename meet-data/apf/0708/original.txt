"Many newcomers to the sport of powerlifting are perplexed at the sheer number of federations and organizations within the sport. There is, however, no question that the American Powerlifting Federation is leading the pack with an ever increasing statewide presence. Lifters are flocking to state meets across the country because they are APF sanctioned and the individuals involved in these various states are passionate about the sport and are giving 100% effort to provide exciting, fair and fun lifting competitions for all involved. My 2007 APF/AAPF Georgia State PL and BP Championships was no different."



"For the 5th straight year we dragged out the Monolifts, the Forza competition benches, the Okie DL bars, the Frantz 55lb squat bars, the Ivanko kilo plates, and a ton of plywood, carpet and rubber mats to set up the smoothest and easily the best Georgia APF State Meet to date. I must thank all the guys from NGBB who helped run the platform and set up the meet; this is thankless and tiring work and without good help in this area a meet would be nothing short of chaotic. I reserve one of the largest thank-you’s for USAPL lifter, powerlifting historian and overall great guy Patrick Anderson for announcing this meet from start to finish; he kept it exciting and fact filled and made the meet great. I also spent countless hours hand picking the perfect group of APF referees so that the meet would be judged fairly and correctly. With the help of Tommy Fannon, Mike Lanier, Shelby Robbins, Bob Lovelace, Scott Albano, Darrell Hoard, Glenn Baggett and Jesse Rodgers I believe this was achieved. Thank-you."



"In regards to the lifting, there were right at 50 competitors ranging from novice level to Pro caliber world record holders. It’s pretty inspiring to a newer lifter or powerlifting fan to look around and see Steve Goggins, Garry Frank, Kara Bohigian, Jim Hoskinson and Sam Byrd amongst others walking around the venue and socializing with everyone. There were several notable performances. In the benchpress, 60 year old Leonard McCormick from Auburn, Alabama, who has suffered a stroke and has trouble coordinating his right hand and foot, benched over 200 pounds bare chested; the man is an incredible testament to the benefits of strength training. Brant Bishop entered AAPF and stroked his 534 opener to take Best Lifter. Likewise, humongous Curtis Dennis, Jr. also took Best Lifter in the APF Bench Only category with the biggest press of the meet. His 705 bench was a 115 pound increase in only 2 months. Awesome progress, Curt."



"In the full meet, Angela Watson hit all PR’s to total impressive and take home the Women’s Best lifter award. Master Lifter Emory Burns came within only a hair of locking in a 9 for 9 day and kept the crowd entertained with some awesome strength and tenacity. The 242 Open division had a good battle between Buford, Georgia’s Pat Hall, 44, and 22 year old Steve Dwelle. Pat’s experience and a 744 pull closed the gap and shut Steve down. These guys were talented with tons of big lifts left in the tank. The 275 division showed the emergence of a big and powerful Toby Irby from Lake City, Florida. Toby wrecked havoc on a 1003 PR squat then continued with balanced numbers to total a 2403 and take home the full meet Best Lifter award. Also in the 275’s was Georgia Tech student Drew Sheffield. Drew put a remarkable 500 pounds on his total in 5 months and cracked his 1st 2000+ total. NGBB is proud of Drew and his hard work in the gym. There were many, many other worthy competitors and a lot of great totals at this meet."



"Clearly, the most amazing thing on September 15th in Woodstock, Georgia was the presence of Sam Byrd and Big Jim Hoskinson on the platform. Sam is like no other and un-tapped of potential. He is Coan-esque in his balance and abilities with a barbell. At 218 rock hard pounds, Sam annihilated a 1015 squat opener, crushed a second with 1063 for an all-time WR and tried 1102. Only the set-up in the monolift held this big number back this day. He benched a nearly effortless 611 then pulled a 733 that appeared so easy one had to wonder if there had been a misload. Sam’s new sumo style has taken his deadlift to new levels and it is just beginning to mature. Jim Hoskinson, also a pro caliber powerlifter, works himself into a frenzy before attempts and is a crowd favorite. His new squat stance looked fantastic, though he just got his opener with 1058. He capped his total off with right at a 700 bench and 700 pull for a big 2453 total, the biggest total in Georgia on this day. The crazy part is that neither one of these lifters were really 100% for this meet and were just “having fun”. I’d like to once again thank everyone who supports APF powerlifting in Georgia. I look forward to another successful year in 2008!!"
