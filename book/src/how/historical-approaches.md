## Historical Approaches
OpenPowerlifting is the 4th generation in the line of Powerlifting record-keeping technology.
Before exploring why our project required a new design, it's worth seeing what others did before us and what we learned from those attempts.

### 1st Generation: Herb Glossbrenner, Michael Soong, and Powerlifting USA
Cross-federation record-keeping began with [Herb Glossbrenner](https://www.openpowerlifting.org/u/herbglossbrenner) in the 1970s.
At that time, there were not many competitions, so Herb would simply travel around and take notes on the best performances.
Occasionally competition results would be published in federations' newsletters, or he'd hear about them by word-of-mouth, and he'd update the record books accordingly.

After doing that for a while, Glossbrenner became widely known in the community as the Powerlifting record-keeper.
He functioned as the sole conduit for reporting and learning about records.
Competitors in-the-know would call him to learn what records they should aim to beat.

As the sport grew, this presented some problems:
 1. The records were really best-effort. Nobody knew if they were correct, particularly if they were set in foreign countries without personal connections to Glossbrenner.
 2. Because people were solely depending on Herb, and he cared about the sport, he spent increasingly unreasonable amounts of time searching for meet results to look for outstanding performances.
    Record-keeping became bottlenecked on the personal investigative abilities and time of a single person.

He would eventually find a temporary solution to these problems by publishing his record-books in the Powerlifting USA magazine.

#### Powerlifting USA
_Powerlifting USA_ was a widely-distributed national magazine in the United States from the late 1970s through 2012.
Each issue typically included at least one of two popular sections: Jean Lamport's "Best 100 of the Year" lists and Herb Glossbrenner's "History's All-Time Best" lists.

Jean Lamport meticulously (and manually!) compiled Top 100 lifts for a year from the lifters whose results were submitted to Powerlifting USA.
This had the dual impact of informing lifters how they're likely to fare nationally and increasing the likelihood of meet directors to send in their results.

> ```

> 2  570 Wright, C 4/22/79    385 Hayataka, T 3/23/79    644 Hicks, T 4/21/79
> 3  560 Jones, D 8/11/79     385 Rafael, A 7/14/79      630 Facteau, M 12/16/79
> ```
> Published in Powerlifting USA Vol.3 No.8 Feb/1980, Page 19.

Herb became the official "Powerlifting USA Statistician," which greatly increased his reach.
He successfully continued with this manual-curation strategy until his retirement from record-keeping.
Glossbrenner passed ownership of his record books to a new collaborator, Michael Soong, who continued working in a similar manner
(switching from notebooks to a word processor).

> Sample excerpt from Herb Glossbrenner's *History's All Time Best Bench Pressers 550lbs/249kg or more*.
> ```
> 675.0 Williams, J (USA-72)  617.4 Bouvier, W (USA-80)  609.94 Hardman, T (USA-81)
> 661.4 Kazmaier, B (USA-81)  616.25 Casey, P (USA-66)   606.27 Reinhoudt, D (USA-75)
> 628.3 Hedlund, L (Swe-80)   611.8 Young, D (USA-78)    603.0 MacDonald, M (USA-77)
> ```
> Published in Powerlifting USA Vol.5 No.9 Mar/1982, Page 65.

#### Take-Away Lessons
Even though this was the first attempt at maintaining records for a nascent sport, the difficulties experienced by Glossbrenner and Soong still yield some useful observations:

- Word-of-mouth works surprisingly well for distributing information over a long timeframe.
- The scope of any one person is inherently limited. A successful project needs *many* collaborators.
- Stumbling upon published results isn't sufficient for correctness. A more structured approach is needed to guarantee that no results are skipped.


### 2nd Generation: Powerlifting Watch
Founded in 2005, [Powerlifting Watch](http://www.powerliftingwatch.com/) is a website that functioned as _Powerlifting USA Online_.

It contained the same information as Powerlifting USA: articles, training updates, and community announcements.
Publishing on the Web instead of in a magazine largely solved the issue of information distribution.
Eventually, Michael Soong joined up with Powerlifting Watch to publish his record books on the website.

At about the same time, Powerlifting Watch launched a "Yearly Top 50 Lifter Rankings" feature.
Like the Lamport rankings published in Powerlifting USA, these new rankings were:
 1. Only accessible to lifters who paid to view them.
 2. Updated from meet results that federations specifically sent in.
 3. Updated from lifters pointing out errors.

Aside from faster distribution, this approach was ultimately structurally identical to the pen-and-paper approach.
Still, the ease of distribution won out, and Powerlifting Watch eclipsed Powerlifting USA for records information.

#### SPF Controversy
After Powerlifting Watch became the dominant source of community records, their record-keepers attempted to use their authority to editorialize by banning the Southern Powerlifting Federation, which was notorious for passing high squats.

The community backlash was swift.
Powerlifting Watch ultimately was forced to back down, suffering permanent reputation damage.

#### Take-Away Lessons
- Popular record-books are thought of as belonging to the community, and resist editorialization.
- Asking federations to send in results isn't sufficient for correctness.
  Federations will not cooperate.
