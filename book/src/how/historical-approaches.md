## Historical Approaches

OpenPowerlifting is the 4th generation in the line of Powerlifting record-keeping technology.
Before exploring why our project required a new design, it's worth seeing what others did before us and what we learned from those attempts.

### 1st Generation: Herb Glossbrenner, Michael Soong, and PowerliftingUSA

Cross-federation record-keeping began with [Herb Glossbrenner](https://www.openpowerlifting.org/u/herbglossbrenner) in the 1970s.
At that time, there were not many competitions, so the method he used was sufficiently simple: Herb would travel around and take notes on the best performances.
Occasionally competition results would be published in federations' newsletters, or he'd hear about them by word-of-mouth, and he'd update the record books accordingly.

After doing that for a while, Herb became widely known in the community as the Powerlifting record-keeper.
Indeed, he functioned as the sole conduit for reporting and learning about records.
Competitors in-the-know would call him to learn what records they should aim to beat.

As the sport grew, this presented some problems:
 1. The records were really best-effort. Nobody knew if they were correct, particularly if they were set in foreign countries without personal connections to Glossbrenner.
 2. Because people were solely depending on Herb, and he cared about the sport, he spent increasingly unreasonable amounts of time searching for meet results to look for outstanding performances.
    Record-keeping became bottlenecked on the personal investigative abilities and time of a single person.

Herb would eventually find a temporary solution to these problems by publishing his record-books in the PowerliftingUSA magazine.

#### PowerliftingUSA

PowerliftingUSA was a widely-distributed national magazine in the United States from the late 1970s through 2012.
Each issue typically included at least one of two popular sections: Jean Lamport's "Best 100 of the Year" lists and Herb Glossbrenner's "History's All-Time Best" lists.

Jean Lamport meticulously (and manually!) compiled Top 100 lifts for a year from the lifters whose results were submitted to PowerliftingUSA.
This had the dual impact of informing lifters how they're likely to fare nationally and increasing the likelihood of meet directors to send in their results.

Herb became the "PowerliftingUSA Statistician," which greatly increased his reach.
