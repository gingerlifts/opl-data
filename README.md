## Development Installation

### Fedora 31

First, install the "nightly" version of the Rust programming language using `rustup`:

```bash
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
```

When a menu appears, choose "Customize installation".<br/>
Press the Enter key until it asks `Default toolchain?`. Type `nightly` and press Enter.<br/>
Continue pressing Enter at the remaining prompts until Rust is installed.

Log out and log back in to allow `~/.cargo/bin` to be part of your default shell `$PATH`.

Install dependencies:

```bash
sudo dnf install make npm python3-beautifulsoup4 python3-flake8 ansible parallel uglify-js
```

Build the project and run the server:

```bash
make
cd server
cargo run --release
```

### Docker

To run the server using Docker, simply build and run:

```
docker build -t opl .
docker run -p 8000:8000 opl
```

Access at http://localhost:8000/ per usual.
