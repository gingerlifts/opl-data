# Guidelines for Interacting with Facebook Audience

This document contains general guidelines on how to interact with people on Facebook. It is expected that the brand guidelines have been fully read and understood before reading this document. Facebook staff are also expected to be familiarized and up-to-date with how Facebook Pages works. The more staff learn about Facebook Pages the more OpenPowerlifting will grow on Facebook. When staff post on any form of social media representing OpenPowerlifting they are expected to follow the brand guidelines. Remember, when staff post as Open Powerlifting they must properly represent OpenPowerlifting.

## Representing the Brand

Staff are expected to reflect a positive image of the brand and must follow these rules in order to do so:
1. Staff should follow all brand guidelines.
2. Staff should be respectful.
3. Staff should refrain from using profanity or any derogatory or unprofessional language.
4. Most importantly, staff should remain professional.

Failure to follow any of the above rules will not reflect the image that Open Powerlifting strives to achieve.

## Engaging Audience

Post engagement is the key to growing a successful Facebook page. Part of post engagement is commenting. The more comments on a post, the more the post shows up in the Facebook audiences' newsfeeds. There are many ways post engagement can be increased. One method to increase post engagement is simply talking to the audience in the comments. Staff should try to engage the audience in Facebook posts by replying to their comments with things appropriate to the post. Audience engagement is vital; an unengaged audience will more than likely never see a page's posts, which makes it nearly impossible to increase reach and other insights vital to a pages growth.
1. Try to interact with the audience every now and then.

## Responding to Messages/Comments

When communicating with the Facebook audience staff are to be helpful and resourceful with any needs the Facebook audience may have. The main goal of the OpenPowerlifting Project is to maintain a highly accurate database for powerlifting that is also quick and easy to access. This also extends to Facebook; the audience should be able to rely on OpenPowerlifting to quickly help with problems. This will build a positive brand image. Many times the audience will not comment or message the page with compliments but with concerns or problems (i.e. my total is wrong or your rankings are wrong). No matter how disrespectful a comment or message may be it is important to develop a professional, short, and to-the-point response that helps solve the problem. In order to grow and become known to the entire powerlifting community, the project must not ruin any relationships with lifters and/or federations. Staff should prioritize responding to messages or comments so that issues can be fixed. Some basic rules to follow when communicating with the Facebook audience are:
1. Staff should follow all of the above rules listed under "Representing the Brand".
2. Staff should fix problems/answer questions as quickly as possible.
3. Staff should maintain a good relationship with lifters and federations (see more below).

## Dealing with Trolls/Blocking

Every now and then staff may encounter an internet "troll" or someone who is trying to get in the way on Facebook. However, staff must not mistake concerns or complaints about trolling. Complaints and concerns must be addressed swiftly. If an individual's complaints are repeatedly annoying and rude the blocking process below should be followed. Staff must not silence complaints and opinions, but some individuals are only on Facebook to "troll" and get in the way. Staff must not make a big deal out of blocking someone (e.g. ranting about trolls). If a certain individual becomes a problem the blocking process below should be followed. There will be no extra comments or posts about blocking, this only stirs things up and is very unprofessional. Here are the basic guidelines on dealing with trolls:
1. Complaints should not be confused with trolling.
2. If someone becomes a problem they should be blocked promptly.
3. Staff should not make any posts or comments regarding blocking or banning individuals.

Here is the process of blocking an individual:
1. If an individual's comment(s) are rude, profane, or otherwise deemed inappropriate by staff the comment should be deleted as soon as possible first. After the comment is deleted the individual should be warned via private message, "Your comment on our post was inappropriate and any subsequent behavior will result in being blocked from our page.". Staff should not say anything else other than the response in quotations.
2. If an individual's comment(s) are rude, profane, or otherwise deemed inappropriate by staff after being warned by private message the individual will be blocked.
3. If an individual's comment(s) are deemed exceptionally rude, profane, or otherwise deemed inappropriate by staff the individual may be immediately blocked at the discretion of staff.

## Maintaining Control on Comment Threads

Staff should maintain control over comment threads. Staff intervention on comment threads may be rare, but certain situations may call for staff intervention. Comment threads should not get out of control with individuals arguing or with individuals exhibiting behavior that could result in blocking If a comment thread starts to get out of control staff should take the following actions:
1. Delete all comments where the discussion has gotten out of control.
2. Address individuals by using the process for blocking an individual above.
3. Staff should not post anything in any comment thread that has gotten out of control, but rather follow the steps above.

It is also important that staff do not intervene in discussions or debates that do not exhibit behavior that could result in blocking, OpenPowerlifting does not try to censor opinions.

## Maintaining and Creating Mainting Relationships

OpenPowerlifting believes in developing positive relationships with all powerlifters and powerlifting federations. Cooperation between OpenPowerlifting and powerlifting federations and their lifters is necessary to the success of the project. At no point should any post, comment, or message jeopardize the relationship between OpenPowerlifting and any powerlifting federation or powerlifter. Staff is to remain professional and neutral to any bias towards one federation or another. Staff is encouraged to talk about ranking within federations and build relationships with federations on Facebook. Staff is also encouraged to tag federations and lifters (see more below). There is more information about relationships in the Brand Guidelines. Concerning relationships staff should remember the following:
1. Positive relationships between OpenPowerlifting and powerlifting federations is necessary. 
2. These relationships cannot be jeopardized.
3. Staff should remain professional and unbiased when operating the Facebook page.
4. Staff is encouraged to talk about federation rankings and tag federations/lifters.

## Posting Frequency

When and how often posts are made is important for post reach on Facebook. The best posting frequency is about once per day or five to ten posts per week. Staff should also aim to post during the afternoon (i.e. 12 p.m. to 3 p.m.) as this is the best time period. Staff should avoid posting too late or too early in the day as these posts will likely not be seen by the majority of the audience. If possible, staff should try to post or schedule their posts at reasonable times of the day. Due to the complexity of Facebook's algorithms, a trial and error method may also work to determine what time of day gets the most amount of reach for a post. Here are some guidelines for posting frequency:
1. There should be one post per day or five to ten posts per week.
2. Posts should be made at reasonable times of the day.

## Meeting the Needs of the Audience

In order to be successful on Facebook, it is necessary that a page meets the needs of the audience. Staff needs to post what is popular amongst the audience, therefore satisfying the audience's needs. OpenPowerlifting's audience is the Powerlifting community and OpenPowerlifting's mission is creating an easy-to-access and accurate powerlifting database. Staff's posts need to satisfy both of the aforementioned items by involving both OpenPowerlifting's mission and the needs of the powerlifting community in some aspect. The needs of the audience are dynamic, so it may not always be easy to meet its exact needs. General suggestions for meeting the needs of the audience are:
1. When posting keep in mind that the goal is to satisfy the needs of the audience.
2. Posts should stay in line with OpenPowerlifting's mission and the needs of the powerlifting community.

Another important part of meeting the audience's needs is the length of posts. Long Facebook posts are proven to be ineffective. Staff should aim to keep posts short and to-the-point. A long post where the audience will have to click "continue reading" will most likely be overlooked.

## Appropriateness of Posts

Staff must make sure posts remain appropriate. Posts need to remain professional and follow the brand guidelines at all times. Posts need to satisfy the needs of the audience above all because this is the key to a successful Facebook page. Random, unprofessional, or unrelated posts (e.g. memes) should be avoided. Posts that provoke a negative response, debate or spark controversy should also be avoided. Clickbait posts are also unacceptable. Make sure all posts follow these rules of appropriateness:
1. Posts should remain professional and follow brand guidelines at all times.
2. Memes should not be posted (unprofessional).
3. Posts should not provoke a negative response.
4. Clickbait should be avoided.


## Sharing Posts

Staff is encouraged to share posts that include topics relevant to the mission of OpenPowerlifting and the needs of the audience. Staff should abstain from sharing controversial posts as this appears unprofessional. Staff is not to share any posts that would violate the brand guidelines. Sharing posts will help network OpenPowerlifting to the rest of the powerlifting community. When it comes to sharing posts staff should remember:
1. Sharing is encouraged.
2. Staff should not share controversial or unrelated posts.
3. Sharing helps network OpenPowerlifting.


## Tagging

Staff is encouraged to tag lifters, organizations, and federations when talking about them in posts. Tagging like sharing helps network OpenPowerlifting to the rest of the powerlifting community. All staff needs to know about tagging is:
1. Tagging is good!


## Coordinating Posts

Staff is expected to communicate and coordinate with each other about who is posting for the day. Coordinating which staff member will be posting for the day will avoid confusion and multiple posts. A posting schedule should be formed. In a posting schedule, each staff member will be assigned a day of the week to post. Scheduling posts are recommended for staff that may be busy during the day or unable to post when they are scheduled to. If the staff member assigned to post cannot post on a given day he or she should contact other staff to have them post instead. The following should be considered in regards to coordinating posts:
1. A posting schedule should be formed.
2. Staff should communicate with each other as to who will be posting for the day.
3. If the staff member assigned to post cannot post he or she should let other staff know.
4. Posting should follow the "Posting Frequency" guidelines mentioned above.

## Post Approval/Disclaimer
All posts should be posted in the #facebook-approvals channel for approval prior to posting. Either @sstangl or @trystanoakley will approve of the post or ask for changes. If changes are requested, please re-submit the new version for approval, even if it's something that should obviously be approved. All posts and graphics should include the following disclaimer: "As fetched on YEAR-MONTH-DAY.
