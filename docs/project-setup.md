## [Optional] Building the Backend

Openpowerlifting is currently developing a backend in Rust using the Rocket web
framework.  To install this subproject, see the following steps.

### Installing Rust and Cargo

Visit [rustup](https://www.rustup.rs/) and download `rustup`, the Rust
installer.
Following the command line instructions, install the `nightly` version. The
nightly version is required to build the `server/` subproject.

### Building the server
In the `server/` directory, run

```cargo build```

### Running the server
In the `server/` directory, run 

```cargo run```

The project should now be viewable at the default location of `localhost:8000`
